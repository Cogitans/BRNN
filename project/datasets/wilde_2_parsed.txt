MRS MARCHMONT.;   Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret? 
LADY BASILDON.;   I suppose so.
LADY BASILDON.; Are you? 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Yes.
MRS MARCHMONT.; Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they? 
LADY BASILDON.;   Horribly tedious!
LADY BASILDON.; Never know why I go.
LADY BASILDON.; Never know why I go anywhere. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   I come here to be educated. 
LADY BASILDON.;   Ah!
LADY BASILDON.; I hate being educated! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   So do I.
MRS MARCHMONT.; It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it?
MRS MARCHMONT.; But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.
MRS MARCHMONT.; So I come here to try to find one. 
LADY BASILDON.;     I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
LADY BASILDON.; The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   How very trivial of him! 
LADY BASILDON.;   Terribly trivial!
LADY BASILDON.; What did your man talk about? 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   About myself. 
LADY BASILDON.;     And were you interested? 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Not in the smallest degree. 
LADY BASILDON.;   What martyrs we are, dear Margaret! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     And how well it becomes us, Olivia! 
MASON.;     Mr. and Lady Jane Barford.
MASON.; Lord Caversham. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Good evening, Lady Chiltern!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Has my good-for-nothing young son been here? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Because he leads such an idle life. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   How can you say such a thing?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Why, he rides in the Row at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;    You are a very charming young lady! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Do come to us more often.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you look so well with your star! 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Never go anywhere now.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Sick of London Society.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife’s milliner.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh, I love London Society!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I think it has immensely improved.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Just what Society should be. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Hum!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Which is Goring?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Beautiful idiot, or the other thing? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.
MABEL CHILTERN.; But he is developing charmingly! 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Into what? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham! 
MASON.;     Lady Markby.
MASON.; Mrs. Cheveley. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Good evening, dear Gertrude!
LADY MARKBY.; So kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.
LADY MARKBY.; Two such charming women should know each other! 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have met before.
LADY CHILTERN.; I did not know she had married a second time. 
LADY MARKBY.;     Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don’t they?
LADY MARKBY.; It is most fashionable.
LADY MARKBY.; Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?
LADY MARKBY.; Brain still weak, I suppose?
LADY MARKBY.; Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?
LADY MARKBY.; His good father was just the same.
LADY MARKBY.; There is nothing like race, is there? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I can’t remember where.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have been out of England for so long. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Indeed?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have forgotten all about my schooldays.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have a vague impression that they were detestable. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I am not surprised! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Do you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.
MRS CHEVELEY.; They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That in itself is fame, on the continent. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!   
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   Ah!
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; chère Madame, queue surprise!
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; I have not seen you since Berlin! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Not since Berlin, Vicomte.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Five years ago! 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   And you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; How do you manage it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself. 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   Ah!
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; you flatter me.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; You butter me, as they say here. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Do they say that here?
MRS CHEVELEY.; How dreadful of them! 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   Yes, they have a wonderful language.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; It should be more widely known. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Good evening, Lady Markby!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I hope you have brought Sir John with you? 
LADY MARKBY.;   Oh!
LADY MARKBY.; I have brought a much more charming person than Sir John.
LADY MARKBY.; Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable.
LADY MARKBY.; Really, now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I hope not, Lady Markby.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; At any rate we do our best to waste the public time, don’t we?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us? 
LADY MARKBY.;   Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!
LADY MARKBY.; One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose.
LADY MARKBY.; But I really don’t know.
LADY MARKBY.; Families are so mixed nowadays.
LADY MARKBY.; Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Mrs. Cheveley?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I seem to know the name. 
LADY MARKBY.;   She has just arrived from Vienna. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Ah!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I think I know whom you mean. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Oh!
LADY MARKBY.; she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends.
LADY MARKBY.; I really must go to Vienna next winter.
LADY MARKBY.; I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have to be recalled.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I should like to see her. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Let me introduce you.
LADY MARKBY.; My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Our attachés at Vienna write to us about nothing else. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thank you, Sir Robert.
MRS CHEVELEY.; An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It starts in the right manner.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Really? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; She has just reminded me that we were at school together.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I remember it perfectly now.
MRS CHEVELEY.; She always got the good conduct prize.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   My prizes came a little later on in life.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I don’t think any of them were for good conduct.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I forget! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I am sure they were for something charming! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I think they are usually punished for it!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!
MRS CHEVELEY.; At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What an appalling philosophy that sounds!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, I’m neither.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Besides, they are both of them merely poses. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You prefer to be natural? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Sometimes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What would those modern psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Ah!
MRS CHEVELEY.; the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Men can be analysed, women .
MRS CHEVELEY.; merely adored. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You think science cannot grapple with the problem of women? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Science can never grapple with the irrational.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is why it has no future before it, in this world. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   And women represent the irrational. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Well-dressed women do. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I fear I could hardly agree with you there.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But do sit down.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London—or perhaps the question is indiscreet? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Questions are never indiscreet.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Answers sometimes are. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Politics are my only pleasure.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I prefer politics.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I think they are more .
MRS CHEVELEY.; becoming! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   A political life is a noble career! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Sometimes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And sometimes it is a great nuisance. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Which do you find it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I?
MRS CHEVELEY.; A combination of all three.   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Allow me! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Our season is almost over. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I don’t care about the London season!
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is too matrimonial.
MRS CHEVELEY.; People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I wanted to meet you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is quite true.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You know what a woman’s curiosity is.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Almost as great as a man’s!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I wanted immensely to meet you, and .
MRS CHEVELEY.; to ask you to do something for me. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I find that little things are so very difficult to do. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     No, I don’t think it is quite a little thing. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I am so glad.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do tell me what it is. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Later on.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And now may I walk through your beautiful house?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I hear your pictures are charming.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Poor Baron Arnheim—you remember the Baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Did you know Baron Arnheim well? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Intimately.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Did you? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   At one time. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Wonderful man, wasn’t he? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     He was very remarkable, in many ways. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs.
MRS CHEVELEY.; They would have been most interesting. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old Greek. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him. 
MASON.;   Lord Goring. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Good evening, my dear Arthur!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I have met Lord Goring before. 
LORD GORING.;     I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   My memory is under admirable control.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And are you still a bachelor? 
LORD GORING.;   I .
LORD GORING.; believe so. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   How very romantic! 
LORD GORING.;   Oh!
LORD GORING.; I am not at all romantic.
LORD GORING.; I am not old enough.
LORD GORING.; I leave romance to my seniors. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring is the result of Boodle’s Club, Mrs. Cheveley. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   He reflects every credit on the institution. 
LORD GORING.;   May I ask are you staying in London long? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   That depends partly on the weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You are not going to plunge us into a European war, I hope? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   There is no danger, at present! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You are very late! 
LORD GORING.;   Have you missed me? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Awfully! 
LORD GORING.;   Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.
LORD GORING.; I like being missed. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   How very selfish of you! 
LORD GORING.;   I am very selfish. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord Goring. 
LORD GORING.;   I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Are the others very bad? 
LORD GORING.;   Quite dreadful!
LORD GORING.; When I think of them at night I go to sleep at once. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Well, I delight in your bad qualities.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wouldn’t have you part with one of them. 
LORD GORING.;   How very nice of you!
LORD GORING.; But then you are always nice.
LORD GORING.; By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.
LORD GORING.; Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here?
LORD GORING.; That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Why do you ask? 
LORD GORING.;   I haven’t seen her for years, that is all. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   What an absurd reason! 
LORD GORING.;   All reasons are absurd. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   What sort of a woman is she? 
LORD GORING.;   Oh!
LORD GORING.; a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I dislike her already. 
LORD GORING.;   That shows your admirable good taste. 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;     Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; Quite the dragon of good taste. 
LORD GORING.;   So the newspapers are always telling us. 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   I read all your English newspapers.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; I find them so amusing. 
LORD GORING.;   Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between the lines. 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   I should like to, but my professor objects.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room, Mademoiselle? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Delighted, Vicomte, quite delighted!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Aren’t you coming to the music-room? 
LORD GORING.;   Not if there is any music going on, Miss Mabel. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     The music is in German.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You would not understand it. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, sir!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; what are you doing here?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Wasting your life as usual!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You should be in bed, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You keep too late hours!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the morning! 
LORD GORING.;   Only a quarter to four, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Can’t make out how you stand London Society.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing. 
LORD GORING.;   I love talking about nothing, father.
LORD GORING.; It is the only thing I know anything about. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   You seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure. 
LORD GORING.;   What else is there to live for, father?
LORD GORING.; Nothing ages like happiness. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   You are heartless, sir, very heartless! 
LORD GORING.;   I hope not, father.
LORD GORING.; Good evening, Lady Basildon! 
LADY BASILDON.;     Are you here?
LADY BASILDON.; I had no idea you ever came to political parties! 
LORD GORING.;   I adore political parties.
LORD GORING.; They are the only place left to us where people don’t talk politics. 
LADY BASILDON.;   I delight in talking politics.
LADY BASILDON.; I talk them all day long.
LADY BASILDON.; But I can’t bear listening to them.
LADY BASILDON.; I don’t know how the unfortunate men in the House stand these long debates. 
LORD GORING.;   By never listening. 
LADY BASILDON.;   Really? 
LORD GORING.;     Of course.
LORD GORING.; You see, it is a very dangerous thing to listen.
LORD GORING.; If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person. 
LADY BASILDON.;   Ah!
LADY BASILDON.; that accounts for so much in men that I have never understood, and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in them! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Our husbands never appreciate anything in us.
MRS MARCHMONT.; We have to go to others for that! 
LADY BASILDON.;     Yes, always to others, have we not? 
LORD GORING.;     And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   That is exactly what we can’t stand.
MRS MARCHMONT.; My Reginald is quite hopelessly faultless.
MRS MARCHMONT.; He is really unendurably so, at times!
MRS MARCHMONT.; There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him. 
LORD GORING.;   How terrible!
LORD GORING.; Really, the thing should be more widely known! 
LADY BASILDON.;   Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was a bachelor. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     My poor Olivia!
MRS MARCHMONT.; We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it. 
LORD GORING.;   I should have thought it was the husbands who were punished. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Oh, dear no!
MRS MARCHMONT.; They are as happy as possible!
MRS MARCHMONT.; And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust us. 
LADY BASILDON.;   Perfectly tragic! 
LORD GORING.;   Or comic, Lady Basildon? 
LADY BASILDON.;   Certainly not comic, Lord Goring.
LADY BASILDON.; How unkind of you to suggest such a thing! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   I am afraid Lord Goring is in the camp of the enemy, as usual.
MRS MARCHMONT.; I saw him talking to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in. 
LORD GORING.;   Handsome woman, Mrs. Cheveley! 
LADY BASILDON.;     Please don’t praise other women in our presence.
LADY BASILDON.; You might wait for us to do that! 
LORD GORING.;   I did wait. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Well, we are not going to praise her.
MRS MARCHMONT.; I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as far as she could see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies. 
LORD GORING.;   She is quite right, too.
LORD GORING.; The men are all dowdies and the women are all dandies, aren’t they? 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Oh!
MRS MARCHMONT.; do you really think that is what Mrs. Cheveley meant? 
LORD GORING.;   Of course.
LORD GORING.; And a very sensible remark for Mrs. Cheveley to make, too. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Why are you talking about Mrs. Cheveley?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Lord Goring says—what did you say, Lord Goring, about Mrs. Cheveley?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I remember, that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night. 
LADY BASILDON.;   What a horrid combination!
LADY BASILDON.; So very unnatural! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     I like looking at geniuses, and listening to beautiful people. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; that is morbid of you, Mrs. Marchmont! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     I am so glad to hear you say that.
MRS MARCHMONT.; Marchmont and I have been married for seven years, and he has never once told me that I was morbid.
MRS MARCHMONT.; Men are so painfully unobservant! 
LADY BASILDON.;     I have always said, dear Margaret, that you were the most morbid person in London. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Ah!
MRS MARCHMONT.; but you are always sympathetic, Olivia! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Is it morbid to have a desire for food?
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have a great desire for food.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Lord Goring, will you give me some supper? 
LORD GORING.;   With pleasure, Miss Mabel.   
MABEL CHILTERN.;   How horrid you have been!
MABEL CHILTERN.; You have never talked to me the whole evening! 
LORD GORING.;   How could I?
LORD GORING.; You went away with the child-diplomatist. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You might have followed us.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Pursuit would have been only polite.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I don’t think I like you at all this evening! 
LORD GORING.;   I like you immensely. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Well, I wish you’d show it in a more marked way!   
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Olivia, I have a curious feeling of absolute faintness.
MRS MARCHMONT.; I think I should like some supper very much.
MRS MARCHMONT.; I know I should like some supper. 
LADY BASILDON.;   I am positively dying for supper, Margaret! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these things. 
LADY BASILDON.;   Men are grossly material, grossly material! 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   May I have the honour of taking you down to supper, Comtesse? 
LADY BASILDON.;     I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte.
LADY BASILDON.; But I will come down with you with pleasure. 
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.;   I am so fond of eating!
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.; I am very English in all my tastes. 
LADY BASILDON.;   You look quite English, Vicomte, quite English. 
MR MONTFORD.;   Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont? 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.
MRS MARCHMONT.; But I will sit beside you, and watch you. 
MR MONTFORD.;   I don’t know that I like being watched when I am eating! 
MRS MARCHMONT.;   Then I will watch some one else. 
MR MONTFORD.;   I don’t know that I should like that either. 
MRS MARCHMONT.;     Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   And are you going to any of our country houses before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, no!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I can’t stand your English house-parties.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is so dreadful of them!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And then the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.
MRS CHEVELEY.; My stay in England really depends on you, Sir Robert.   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Seriously? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Quite seriously.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.
MRS CHEVELEY.; What I don’t like are tedious, practical people.
MRS CHEVELEY.; There is a wide difference.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Besides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You were Lord Radley’s secretary, weren’t you, when the Government bought the Suez Canal shares? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But the Suez Canal was a very great and splendid undertaking.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It gave us our direct route to India.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It had imperial value.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It was necessary that we should have control.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; This Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   A speculation, Sir Robert!
MRS CHEVELEY.; A brilliant, daring speculation. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley, it is a swindle.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Let us call things by their proper names.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It makes matters simpler.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; We have all the information about it at the Foreign Office.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; In fact, I sent out a special Commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The whole thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I hope you have not invested in it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am sure you are far too clever to have done that. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I have invested very largely in it. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Your old friend—and mine. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Who? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Baron Arnheim. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Ah!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I remember hearing, at the time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   It was his last romance.
MRS CHEVELEY.; His last but one, to do him justice. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     But you have not seen my Corots yet.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; They are in the music-room.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Corots seem to go with music, don’t they?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; May I show them to you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I am not in a mood to-night for silver twilights, or rose-pink dawns.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want to talk business. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I fear I have no advice to give you, Mrs. Cheveley, except to interest yourself in something less dangerous.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The success of the Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I am going to lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow night. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   That you must not do.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In your own interests, Sir Robert, to say nothing of mine, you must not do that. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     In my own interests?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; My dear Mrs. Cheveley, what do you mean?   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Sir Robert, I will be quite frank with you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want you to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the House, on the ground that you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Then I want you to say a few words to the effect that the Government is going to reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind.
MRS CHEVELEY.; A few ordinary platitudes will do.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It makes the whole world kin.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Will you do that for me? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Mrs. Cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I am quite serious. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Pray allow me to believe that you are not. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Ah!
MRS CHEVELEY.; but I am.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And if you do what I ask you, I .
MRS CHEVELEY.; will pay you very handsomely! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Pay me! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I am afraid I don’t quite understand what you mean. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     How very disappointing!
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I have come all the way from Vienna in order that you should thoroughly understand me. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I fear I don’t. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the world, and you have your price, I suppose.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Everybody has nowadays.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The drawback is that most people are so dreadfully expensive.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I know I am.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I hope you will be more reasonable in your terms. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     If you will allow me, I will call your carriage for you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You have lived so long abroad, Mrs. Cheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to an English gentleman. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I realise that I am talking to a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a Stock Exchange speculator a Cabinet secret. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     What do you mean? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I mean that I know the real origin of your wealth and your career, and I have got your letter, too. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What letter? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     The letter you wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Radley’s secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal shares—a letter written three days before the Government announced its own purchase. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     It is not true. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You thought that letter had been destroyed.
MRS CHEVELEY.; How foolish of you!
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is in my possession. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   The affair to which you allude was no more than a speculation.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The House of Commons had not yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   It was a swindle, Sir Robert.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Let us call things by their proper names.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It makes everything simpler.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And now I am going to sell you that letter, and the price I ask for it is your public support of the Argentine scheme.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You made your own fortune out of one canal.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You must help me and my friends to make our fortunes out of another! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   It is infamous, what you propose—infamous! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, no!
MRS CHEVELEY.; This is the game of life as we all have to play it, Sir Robert, sooner or later! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I cannot do what you ask me. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You mean you cannot help doing it.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You know you are standing on the edge of a precipice.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And it is not for you to make terms.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is for you to accept them.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Supposing you refuse— 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What then? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   My dear Sir Robert, what then?
MRS CHEVELEY.; You are ruined, that is all!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Remember to what a point your Puritanism in England has brought you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbours.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In fact, to be a bit better than one’s neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle-class.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Nowadays, with our modern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of purity, incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues—and what is the result?
MRS CHEVELEY.; You all go over like ninepins—one after the other.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Not a year passes in England without somebody disappearing.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Scandals used to lend charm, or at least interest, to a man—now they crush him.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And yours is a very nasty scandal.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You couldn’t survive it.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If it were known that as a young man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a Cabinet secret for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of your wealth and career, you would be hounded out of public life, you would disappear completely.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And after all, Sir Robert, why should you sacrifice your entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy?
MRS CHEVELEY.; For the moment I am your enemy.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I admit it!
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I am much stronger than you are.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The big battalions are on my side.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You have a splendid position, but it is your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You can’t defend it!
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I am in attack.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Of course I have not talked morality to you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You must admit in fairness that I have spared you that.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Years ago you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it turned out a great success.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You owe to it your fortune and position.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And now you have got to pay for it.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Sooner or later we have all to pay for what we do.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You have to pay now.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Before I leave you to-night, you have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the House in favour of this scheme. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What you ask is impossible. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You must make it possible.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You are going to make it possible.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Sir Robert, you know what your English newspapers are like.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Suppose that when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Think of their loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of the mud and mire they would plunge you in.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Think of the hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading article, and arranging the foulness of the public placard. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Stop!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You want me to withdraw the report and to make a short speech stating that I believe there are possibilities in the scheme? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Those are my terms. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I will give you any sum of money you want. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back your past.
MRS CHEVELEY.; No man is. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I will not do what you ask me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I will not. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You have to.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If you don’t .
  
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Wait a moment!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What did you propose?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You said that you would give me back my letter, didn’t you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is agreed.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I will be in the Ladies’ Gallery to-morrow night at half-past eleven.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If by that time—and you will have had heaps of opportunity—you have made an announcement to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can think of.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I intend to play quite fairly with you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; One should always play fairly .
MRS CHEVELEY.; when one has the winning cards.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The Baron taught me that .
MRS CHEVELEY.; amongst other things. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You must let me have time to consider your proposal. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   No; you must settle now! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Give me a week—three days! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Impossible!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have got to telegraph to Vienna to-night. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   My God!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; what brought you into my life? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Circumstances.   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Don’t go.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I consent.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The report shall be withdrawn.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thank you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I knew we should come to an amicable agreement.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I understood your nature from the first.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I analysed you, though you did not adore me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And now you can get my carriage for me, Sir Robert.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen always get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.   
LADY MARKBY.;   Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have enjoyed yourself.
LADY MARKBY.; Sir Robert is very entertaining, is he not? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Most entertaining!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have enjoyed my talk with him immensely. 
LADY MARKBY.;   He has had a very interesting and brilliant career.
LADY MARKBY.; And he has married a most admirable wife.
LADY MARKBY.; Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles, I am glad to say.
LADY MARKBY.; I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who do.
LADY MARKBY.; And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.
LADY MARKBY.; But one can’t have everything, can one?
LADY MARKBY.; And now I must go, dear.
LADY MARKBY.; Shall I call for you to-morrow? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks. 
LADY MARKBY.;   We might drive in the Park at five.
LADY MARKBY.; Everything looks so fresh in the Park now! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Except the people! 
LADY MARKBY.;   Perhaps the people are a little jaded.
LADY MARKBY.; I have often observed that the Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of the brain.
LADY MARKBY.; However, I think anything is better than high intellectual pressure.
LADY MARKBY.; That is the most unbecoming thing there is.
LADY MARKBY.; It makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large.
LADY MARKBY.; And there is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose; men don’t like them.
LADY MARKBY.; Good-night, dear!
LADY MARKBY.; Good-night, Gertrude!   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have spent a delightful evening.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It has been so interesting getting to know your husband. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Why did you wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, I will tell you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I wanted to interest him in this Argentine Canal scheme, of which I dare say you have heard.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I found him most susceptible,—susceptible to reason, I mean.
MRS CHEVELEY.; A rare thing in a man.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I converted him in ten minutes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; He is going to make a speech in the House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.
MRS CHEVELEY.; We must go to the Ladies’ Gallery and hear him!
MRS CHEVELEY.; It will be a great occasion! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   There must be some mistake.
LADY CHILTERN.; That scheme could never have my husband’s support. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, I assure you it’s all settled.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I don’t regret my tedious journey from Vienna now.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It has been a great success.
MRS CHEVELEY.; But, of course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead secret. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     A secret?
LADY CHILTERN.; Between whom? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Between your husband and myself. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Your carriage is here, Mrs. Cheveley! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Good evening, Lady Chiltern!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Good-night, Lord Goring!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am at Claridge’s.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Don’t you think you might leave a card? 
LORD GORING.;   If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, don’t be so solemn about it, or I shall be obliged to leave a card on you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; In England I suppose that would hardly be considered en règle.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Abroad, we are more civilised.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Will you see me down, Sir Robert?
MRS CHEVELEY.; Now that we have both the same interests at heart we shall be great friends, I hope! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   What a horrid woman! 
LORD GORING.;   You should go to bed, Miss Mabel. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring! 
LORD GORING.;   My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.
LORD GORING.; I don’t see why I shouldn’t give you the same advice.
LORD GORING.; I always pass on good advice.
LORD GORING.; It is the only thing to do with it.
LORD GORING.; It is never of any use to oneself. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring, you are always ordering me out of the room.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I think it most courageous of you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Especially as I am not going to bed for hours.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You can come and sit down if you like, and talk about anything in the world, except the Royal Academy, Mrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch dialect.
MABEL CHILTERN.; They are not improving subjects.
MABEL CHILTERN.; What is this?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Some one has dropped a diamond brooch!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Quite beautiful, isn’t it?
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wish it was mine, but Gertrude won’t let me wear anything but pearls, and I am thoroughly sick of pearls.
MABEL CHILTERN.; They make one look so plain, so good and so intellectual.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wonder whom the brooch belongs to. 
LORD GORING.;   I wonder who dropped it. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   It is a beautiful brooch. 
LORD GORING.;   It is a handsome bracelet. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   It isn’t a bracelet.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It’s a brooch. 
LORD GORING.;   It can be used as a bracelet.   
MABEL CHILTERN.;   What are you doing? 
LORD GORING.;   Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request to you. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Oh, pray do!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have been waiting for it all the evening. 
LORD GORING.;     Don’t mention to anybody that I have taken charge of this brooch.
LORD GORING.; Should any one write and claim it, let me know at once. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   That is a strange request. 
LORD GORING.;   Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody once, years ago. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You did? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Good-night, Gertrude!   
LADY CHILTERN.;   Good-night, dear!
LADY CHILTERN.; You saw whom Lady Markby brought here to-night? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes.
LORD GORING.; It was an unpleasant surprise.
LORD GORING.; What did she come here for? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Apparently to try and lure Robert to uphold some fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.
LADY CHILTERN.; The Argentine Canal, in fact. 
LORD GORING.;   She has mistaken her man, hasn’t she? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   She is incapable of understanding an upright nature like my husband’s! 
LORD GORING.;   Yes.
LORD GORING.; I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get Robert into her toils.
LORD GORING.; It is extraordinary what astounding mistakes clever women make. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I don’t call women of that kind clever.
LADY CHILTERN.; I call them stupid! 
LORD GORING.;   Same thing often.
LORD GORING.; Good-night, Lady Chiltern! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Good-night! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   My dear Arthur, you are not going?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do stop a little! 
LORD GORING.;   Afraid I can’t, thanks.
LORD GORING.; I have promised to look in at the Hartlocks’.
LORD GORING.; I believe they have got a mauve Hungarian band that plays mauve Hungarian music.
LORD GORING.; See you soon.
LORD GORING.; Good-bye! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   How beautiful you look to-night, Gertrude! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert, it is not true, is it?
LADY CHILTERN.; You are not going to lend your support to this Argentine speculation?
LADY CHILTERN.; You couldn’t! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Who told you I intended to do so? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   That woman who has just gone out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she calls herself now.
LADY CHILTERN.; She seemed to taunt me with it.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, I know this woman.
LADY CHILTERN.; You don’t.
LADY CHILTERN.; We were at school together.
LADY CHILTERN.; She was untruthful, dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she could win.
LADY CHILTERN.; I hated, I despised her.
LADY CHILTERN.; She stole things, she was a thief.
LADY CHILTERN.; She was sent away for being a thief.
LADY CHILTERN.; Why do you let her influence you? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it happened many years ago.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is best forgotten!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Mrs. Cheveley may have changed since then.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; No one should be entirely judged by their past. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     One’s past is what one is.
LADY CHILTERN.; It is the only way by which people should be judged. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   That is a hard saying, Gertrude! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   It is a true saying, Robert.
LADY CHILTERN.; And what did she mean by boasting that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to a thing I have heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme there has ever been in political life? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I was mistaken in the view I took.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; We all may make mistakes. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   But you told me yesterday that you had received the report from the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole thing. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I have reasons now to believe that the Commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Besides, Gertrude, public and private life are different things.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; They have different laws, and move on different lines. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   They should both represent man at his highest.
LADY CHILTERN.; I see no difference between them. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     In the present case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed my mind.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; That is all. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   All! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Yes! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert!
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; it is horrible that I should have to ask you such a question—Robert, are you telling me the whole truth? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Why do you ask me such a question? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Why do you not answer it? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Gertrude, truth is a very complex thing, and politics is a very complex business.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There are wheels within wheels.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; One may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Every one does. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Compromise?
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, why do you talk so differently to-night from the way I have always heard you talk?
LADY CHILTERN.; Why are you changed? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I am not changed.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But circumstances alter things. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Circumstances should never alter principles! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   But if I told you— 
LADY CHILTERN.;   What? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   That it was necessary, vitally necessary? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   It can never be necessary to do what is not honourable.
LADY CHILTERN.; Or if it be necessary, then what is it that I have loved!
LADY CHILTERN.; But it is not, Robert; tell me it is not.
LADY CHILTERN.; Why should it be?
LADY CHILTERN.; What gain would you get?
LADY CHILTERN.; Money?
LADY CHILTERN.; We have no need of that!
LADY CHILTERN.; And money that comes from a tainted source is a degradation.
LADY CHILTERN.; Power?
LADY CHILTERN.; But power is nothing in itself.
LADY CHILTERN.; It is power to do good that is fine—that, and that only.
LADY CHILTERN.; What is it, then?
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, tell me why you are going to do this dishonourable thing! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude, you have no right to use that word.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I told you it was a question of rational compromise.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is no more than that. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert, that is all very well for other men, for men who treat life simply as a sordid speculation; but not for you, Robert, not for you.
LADY CHILTERN.; You are different.
LADY CHILTERN.; All your life you have stood apart from others.
LADY CHILTERN.; You have never let the world soil you.
LADY CHILTERN.; To the world, as to myself, you have been an ideal always.
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; be that ideal still.
LADY CHILTERN.; That great inheritance throw not away—that tower of ivory do not destroy.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, men can love what is beneath them—things unworthy, stained, dishonoured.
LADY CHILTERN.; We women worship when we love; and when we lose our worship, we lose everything.
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; don’t kill my love for you, don’t kill that! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I know that there are men with horrible secrets in their lives—men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame—oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; don’t tell me you are such as they are!
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, is there in your life any secret dishonour or disgrace?
LADY CHILTERN.; Tell me, tell me at once, that— 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   That what? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     That our lives may drift apart. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Drift apart? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   That they may be entirely separate.
LADY CHILTERN.; It would be better for us both. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you might not know. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I was sure of it, Robert, I was sure of it.
LADY CHILTERN.; But why did you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?
LADY CHILTERN.; Don’t let us ever talk about the subject again.
LADY CHILTERN.; You will write, won’t you, to Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers?
LADY CHILTERN.; If you have given her any promise you must take it back, that is all! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Must I write and tell her that? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Surely, Robert!
LADY CHILTERN.; What else is there to do? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I might see her personally.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It would be better. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You must never see her again, Robert.
LADY CHILTERN.; She is not a woman you should ever speak to.
LADY CHILTERN.; She is not worthy to talk to a man like you.
LADY CHILTERN.; No; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your letter show her that your decision is quite irrevocable! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Write this moment! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   But it is so late.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is close on twelve. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   That makes no matter.
LADY CHILTERN.; She must know at once that she has been mistaken in you—and that you are not a man to do anything base or underhand or dishonourable.
LADY CHILTERN.; Write here, Robert.
LADY CHILTERN.; Write that you decline to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme.
LADY CHILTERN.; Yes—write the word dishonest.
LADY CHILTERN.; She knows what that word means.
LADY CHILTERN.; Yes; that will do.
LADY CHILTERN.; And now the envelope.
LADY CHILTERN.; Have this letter sent at once to Claridge’s Hotel.
LADY CHILTERN.; There is no answer.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, love gives one an instinct to things.
LADY CHILTERN.; I feel to-night that I have saved you from something that might have been a danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less than they do.
LADY CHILTERN.; I don’t think you realise sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, a finer attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher ideals—I know it, and for that I love you, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Oh, love me always, Gertrude, love me always! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I will love you always, because you will always be worthy of love.
LADY CHILTERN.; We needs must love the highest when we see it!   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Put out the lights, Mason, put out the lights! 
LORD GORING.;   My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward indeed.
LORD GORING.; You should have told your wife the whole thing.
LORD GORING.; Secrets from other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.
LORD GORING.; So, at least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better.
LORD GORING.; But no man should have a secret from his own wife.
LORD GORING.; She invariably finds it out.
LORD GORING.; Women have a wonderful instinct about things.
LORD GORING.; They can discover everything except the obvious. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When could I have told her?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Not last night.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It would have made a life-long separation between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Last night it would have been quite impossible.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She would have turned from me in horror .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; in horror and in contempt. 
LORD GORING.;   Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that. 
LORD GORING.;     What a pity!
LORD GORING.; I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.
LORD GORING.; But if what you tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with Lady Chiltern. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   It would be quite useless. 
LORD GORING.;   May I try? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views. 
LORD GORING.;   Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   All such experiments are terribly dangerous. 
LORD GORING.;   Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.
LORD GORING.; If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t be worth living.
LORD GORING.; Well, I am bound to say that I think you should have told her years ago. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   When?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When we were engaged?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do you think she would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable? 
LORD GORING.;     Yes; most men would call it ugly names.
LORD GORING.; There is no doubt of that. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Men who every day do something of the same kind themselves.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their own lives. 
LORD GORING.;   That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other people’s secrets.
LORD GORING.; It distracts public attention from their own. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; No one. 
LORD GORING.;     Except yourself, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Of course I had private information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of the day, and I acted on it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Private information is practically the source of every large modern fortune. 
LORD GORING.;     And public scandal invariably the result. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Arthur, do you think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up against me now?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I was twenty-two at the time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two unforgiveable things nowadays.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Is it fair that the folly, the sin of one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have worked for, all that I have built up.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Is it fair, Arthur? 
LORD GORING.;   Life is never fair, Robert.
LORD GORING.; And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What this century worships is wealth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The God of this century is wealth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; To succeed one must have wealth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; At all costs one must have wealth. 
LORD GORING.;   You underrate yourself, Robert.
LORD GORING.; Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   When I was old, perhaps.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I wanted my success when I was young.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Youth is the time for success.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I couldn’t wait. 
LORD GORING.;   Well, you certainly have had your success while you are still young.
LORD GORING.; No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
LORD GORING.; Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good enough for any one, I should think. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   And if it is all taken away from me now?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; If I am hounded from public life? 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I did not sell myself for money.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I bought success at a great price.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; That is all. 
LORD GORING.;     Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
LORD GORING.; But what first made you think of doing such a thing? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Baron Arnheim. 
LORD GORING.;   Damned scoundrel! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   No; he was a man of a most subtle and refined intellect.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; A man of culture, charm, and distinction.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; One of the most intellectual men I ever met. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.
LORD GORING.; There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine.
LORD GORING.; Personally I have a great admiration for stupidity.
LORD GORING.; It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.
LORD GORING.; But how did he do it?
LORD GORING.; Tell me the whole thing. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     One night after dinner at Lord Radley’s the Baron began talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce to an absolutely definite science.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; With that wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous of all gospels, the gospel of gold.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I think he saw the effect he had produced on me, for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see him.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb has now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale, curved lips, he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich possessed it. 
LORD GORING.;     A thoroughly shallow creed. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I didn’t think so then.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I don’t think so now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Wealth has given me enormous power.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You cannot understand what a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Such a chance as few men get. 
LORD GORING.;   Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.
LORD GORING.; But tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do what you did? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   When I was going away he said to me that if I ever could give him any private information of real value he would make me a very rich man.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands. 
LORD GORING.;     State documents? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes.   
LORD GORING.;   I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim held out to you. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Weak?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Sick of using it about others.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Weak?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do you really think, Arthur, that it is weakness that yields to temptation?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no weakness in that.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There is a horrible, a terrible courage.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I had that courage.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction. 
LORD GORING.;   And you? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I received from the Baron £110,000. 
LORD GORING.;   You were worth more, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power over others.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I went into the House immediately.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The Baron advised me in finance from time to time.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Before five years I had almost trebled my fortune.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a success.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; In all things connected with money I have had a luck so extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I remember having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers. 
LORD GORING.;   But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for what you had done? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   No.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won. 
LORD GORING.;     You thought you had won. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I thought so.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you? 
LORD GORING.;     I am very sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I don’t say that I suffered any remorse.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I didn’t.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But I have paid conscience money many times.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I had a wild hope that I might disarm destiny.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in public charities since then. 
LORD GORING.;     In public charities?
LORD GORING.; Dear me!
LORD GORING.; what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Oh, don’t say that, Arthur; don’t talk like that! 
LORD GORING.;   Never mind what I say, Robert!
LORD GORING.; I am always saying what I shouldn’t say.
LORD GORING.; In fact, I usually say what I really think.
LORD GORING.; A great mistake nowadays.
LORD GORING.; It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.
LORD GORING.; As regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can.
LORD GORING.; Of course you know that. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Thank you, Arthur, thank you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But what is to be done?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What can be done? 
LORD GORING.;     Well, the English can’t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.
LORD GORING.; It is one of the best things in them.
LORD GORING.; However, in your case, Robert, a confession would not do.
LORD GORING.; The money, if you will allow me to say so, is .
LORD GORING.; awkward.
LORD GORING.; Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole affair, you would never be able to talk morality again.
LORD GORING.; And in England a man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral audience is quite over as a serious politician.
LORD GORING.; There would be nothing left for him as a profession except Botany or the Church.
LORD GORING.; A confession would be of no use.
LORD GORING.; It would ruin you. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   It would ruin me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing out. 
LORD GORING.;     I was waiting for you to say that, Robert.
LORD GORING.; It is the only thing to do now.
LORD GORING.; And you must begin by telling your wife the whole story. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   That I will not do. 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, believe me, you are wrong. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I couldn’t do it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It would kill her love for me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And now about this woman, this Mrs. Cheveley.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; How can I defend myself against her?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You knew her before, Arthur, apparently. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Did you know her well? 
LORD GORING.;     So little that I got engaged to be married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys’.
LORD GORING.; The affair lasted for three days .
LORD GORING.; nearly. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Why was it broken off? 
LORD GORING.;     Oh, I forget.
LORD GORING.; At least, it makes no matter.
LORD GORING.; By the way, have you tried her with money?
LORD GORING.; She used to be confoundedly fond of money. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I offered her any sum she wanted.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She refused. 
LORD GORING.;   Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down sometimes.
LORD GORING.; The rich can’t do everything, after all. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Not everything.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I suppose you are right.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is in store for me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I feel certain of it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I never knew what terror was before.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I know it now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one’s heart.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is as if one’s heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow. 
LORD GORING.;     Robert, you must fight her.
LORD GORING.; You must fight her. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   But how? 
LORD GORING.;   I can’t tell you how at present.
LORD GORING.; I have not the smallest idea.
LORD GORING.; But every one has some weak point.
LORD GORING.; There is some flaw in each one of us.
LORD GORING.; My father tells me that even I have faults.
LORD GORING.; Perhaps I have.
LORD GORING.; I don’t know. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   In defending myself against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a right to use any weapon I can find, have I not? 
LORD GORING.;     In your place I don’t think I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.
LORD GORING.; She is thoroughly well able to take care of herself. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna, to inquire if there is anything known against her.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There may be some secret scandal she might be afraid of. 
LORD GORING.;     Oh, I should fancy Mrs. Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every afternoon at five-thirty.
LORD GORING.; I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can’t manage to have enough of them. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Why do you say that? 
LORD GORING.;     Well, she wore far too much rouge last night, and not quite enough clothes.
LORD GORING.; That is always a sign of despair in a woman. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     But it is worth while my wiring to Vienna, is it not? 
LORD GORING.;   It is always worth while asking a question, though it is not always worth while answering one. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Is Mr. Trafford in his room? 
MASON.;   Yes, Sir Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There must not be a moment’s delay. 
MASON.;   Yes, Sir Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; just give that back to me again. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   She must have had some curious hold over Baron Arnheim.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I wonder what it was. 
LORD GORING.;     I wonder. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife knows nothing. 
LORD GORING.;     Oh, fight in any case—in any case. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     If my wife found out, there would be little left to fight for.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Well, as soon as I hear from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is a chance, just a chance, but I believe in it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And as I fought the age with its own weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is only fair, and she looks like a woman with a past, doesn’t she? 
LORD GORING.;   Most pretty women do.
LORD GORING.; But there is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in frocks.
LORD GORING.; Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley’s past is merely a slightly décolleté one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
LORD GORING.; Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening Mrs. Cheveley.
LORD GORING.; I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be easily frightened.
LORD GORING.; She has survived all her creditors, and she shows wonderful presence of mind. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I live on hopes now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I clutch at every chance.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The water is round my feet, and the very air is bitter with storm.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Hush!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I hear my wife’s voice. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Good afternoon, Lord Goring! 
LORD GORING.;   Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!
LORD GORING.; Have you been in the Park? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   No; I have just come from the Woman’s Liberal Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud applause, and now I have come in to have my tea.
LADY CHILTERN.; You will wait and have some tea, won’t you? 
LORD GORING.;   I’ll wait for a short time, thanks. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I will be back in a moment.
LADY CHILTERN.; I am only going to take my hat off. 
LORD GORING.;     Oh!
LORD GORING.; please don’t.
LORD GORING.; It is so pretty.
LORD GORING.; One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.
LORD GORING.; I hope the Woman’s Liberal Association received it with loud applause. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     We have much more important work to do than look at each other’s bonnets, Lord Goring. 
LORD GORING.;   Really?
LORD GORING.; What sort of work? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts, Female Inspectors, the Eight Hours’ Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise.
LADY CHILTERN.; Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting. 
LORD GORING.;   And never bonnets? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Never bonnets, never! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     You have been a good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend. 
LORD GORING.;   I don’t know that I have been able to do much for you, Robert, as yet.
LORD GORING.; In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as far as I can see.
LORD GORING.; I am thoroughly disappointed with myself. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You have enabled me to tell you the truth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; That is something.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The truth has always stifled me. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible!
LORD GORING.; Bad habit, by the way.
LORD GORING.; Makes one very unpopular at the club .
LORD GORING.; with the older members.
LORD GORING.; They call it being conceited.
LORD GORING.; Perhaps it is. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I would to God that I had been able to tell the truth .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; to live the truth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Ah!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; that is the great thing in life, to live the truth.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I’ll see you soon again, Arthur, shan’t I? 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly.
LORD GORING.; Whenever you like.
LORD GORING.; I’m going to look in at the Bachelors’ Ball to-night, unless I find something better to do.
LORD GORING.; But I’ll come round to-morrow morning.
LORD GORING.; If you should want me to-night by any chance, send round a note to Curzon Street. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Thank you. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You are not going, Robert? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I have some letters to write, dear. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     You work too hard, Robert.
LADY CHILTERN.; You seem never to think of yourself, and you are looking so tired. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   It is nothing, dear, nothing. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Do sit down.
LADY CHILTERN.; I am so glad you have called.
LADY CHILTERN.; I want to talk to you about .
LADY CHILTERN.; well, not about bonnets, or the Woman’s Liberal Association.
LADY CHILTERN.; You take far too much interest in the first subject, and not nearly enough in the second. 
LORD GORING.;   You want to talk to me about Mrs. Cheveley? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes.
LADY CHILTERN.; You have guessed it.
LADY CHILTERN.; After you left last night I found out that what she had said was really true.
LADY CHILTERN.; Of course I made Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise. 
LORD GORING.;   So he gave me to understand. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   To have kept it would have been the first stain on a career that has been stainless always.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert must be above reproach.
LADY CHILTERN.; He is not like other men.
LADY CHILTERN.; He cannot afford to do what other men do.
LADY CHILTERN.; Don’t you agree with me?
LADY CHILTERN.; You are Robert’s greatest friend.
LADY CHILTERN.; You are our greatest friend, Lord Goring.
LADY CHILTERN.; No one, except myself, knows Robert better than you do.
LADY CHILTERN.; He has no secrets from me, and I don’t think he has any from you. 
LORD GORING.;   He certainly has no secrets from me.
LORD GORING.; At least I don’t think so. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Then am I not right in my estimate of him?
LADY CHILTERN.; I know I am right.
LADY CHILTERN.; But speak to me frankly. 
LORD GORING.;     Quite frankly? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Surely.
LADY CHILTERN.; You have nothing to conceal, have you? 
LORD GORING.;   Nothing.
LORD GORING.; But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that in practical life— 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Of which you know so little, Lord Goring— 
LORD GORING.;   Of which I know nothing by experience, though I know something by observation.
LORD GORING.; I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is unscrupulous always.
LORD GORING.; Once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point, if he has to climb the crag, he climbs the crag; if he has to walk in the mire— 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Well? 
LORD GORING.;   He walks in the mire.
LORD GORING.; Of course I am only talking generally about life. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I hope so.
LADY CHILTERN.; Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring? 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern, I have sometimes thought that .
LORD GORING.; perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life.
LORD GORING.; I think that .
LORD GORING.; often you don’t make sufficient allowances.
LORD GORING.; In every nature there are elements of weakness, or worse than weakness.
LORD GORING.; Supposing, for instance, that—that any public man, my father, or Lord Merton, or Robert, say, had, years ago, written some foolish letter to some one .
 
LADY CHILTERN.;   What do you mean by a foolish letter? 
LORD GORING.;   A letter gravely compromising one’s position.
LORD GORING.; I am only putting an imaginary case. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as he is of doing a wrong thing. 
LORD GORING.;     Nobody is incapable of doing a foolish thing.
LORD GORING.; Nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Are you a Pessimist?
LADY CHILTERN.; What will the other dandies say?
LADY CHILTERN.; They will all have to go into mourning. 
LORD GORING.;     No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist.
LORD GORING.; Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.
LORD GORING.; All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.
LORD GORING.; It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.
LORD GORING.; And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.
LORD GORING.; If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.
LORD GORING.; Come at once to me. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Lord Goring, you are talking quite seriously.
LADY CHILTERN.; I don’t think I ever heard you talk seriously before. 
LORD GORING.;     You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.
LORD GORING.; It won’t occur again, if I can help it. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   But I like you to be serious. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Dear Gertrude, don’t say such a dreadful thing to Lord Goring.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Good afternoon Lord Goring!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Pray be as trivial as you can. 
LORD GORING.;   I should like to, Miss Mabel, but I am afraid I am .
LORD GORING.; a little out of practice this morning; and besides, I have to be going now. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Just when I have come in!
MABEL CHILTERN.; What dreadful manners you have!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am sure you were very badly brought up. 
LORD GORING.;   I was. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I wish I had brought you up! 
LORD GORING.;   I am so sorry you didn’t. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   It is too late now, I suppose? 
LORD GORING.;     I am not so sure. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Will you ride to-morrow morning? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes, at ten. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Don’t forget. 
LORD GORING.;   Of course I shan’t.
LORD GORING.; By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in _The Morning Post_ of to-day.
LORD GORING.; It has apparently been crowded out by the County Council, or the Lambeth Conference, or something equally boring.
LORD GORING.; Could you let me have a list?
LORD GORING.; I have a particular reason for asking you. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I am sure Mr. Trafford will be able to give you one. 
LORD GORING.;   Thanks, so much. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Tommy is the most useful person in London. 
LORD GORING.;    And who is the most ornamental? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;    I am. 
LORD GORING.;   How clever of you to guess it!
LORD GORING.; Good-bye, Lady Chiltern!
LORD GORING.; You will remember what I said to you, won’t you? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes; but I don’t know why you said it to me. 
LORD GORING.;   I hardly know myself.
LORD GORING.; Good-bye, Miss Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;    I wish you were not going.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have had four wonderful adventures this morning; four and a half, in fact.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You might stop and listen to some of them. 
LORD GORING.;   How very selfish of you to have four and a half!
LORD GORING.; There won’t be any left for me. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I don’t want you to have any.
MABEL CHILTERN.; They would not be good for you. 
LORD GORING.;   That is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me.
LORD GORING.; How charmingly you said it!
LORD GORING.; Ten to-morrow. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Sharp. 
LORD GORING.;   Quite sharp.
LORD GORING.; But don’t bring Mr. Trafford. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Of course I shan’t bring Tommy Trafford.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Tommy Trafford is in great disgrace. 
LORD GORING.;   I am delighted to hear it.   
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Gertrude, I wish you would speak to Tommy Trafford. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   What has poor Mr. Trafford done this time?
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert says he is the best secretary he has ever had. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Well, Tommy has proposed to me again.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Tommy really does nothing but propose to me.
MABEL CHILTERN.; He proposed to me last night in the music-room, when I was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio going on.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I didn’t dare to make the smallest repartee, I need hardly tell you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; If I had, it would have stopped the music at once.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Musical people are so absurdly unreasonable.
MABEL CHILTERN.; They always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in front of that dreadful statue of Achilles.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Really, the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite appalling.
MABEL CHILTERN.; The police should interfere.
MABEL CHILTERN.; At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was a bimetallist.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Fortunately I don’t know what bimetallism means.
MABEL CHILTERN.; And I don’t believe anybody else does either.
MABEL CHILTERN.; But the observation crushed Tommy for ten minutes.
MABEL CHILTERN.; He looked quite shocked.
MABEL CHILTERN.; And then Tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes.
MABEL CHILTERN.; If he proposed at the top of his voice, I should not mind so much.
MABEL CHILTERN.; That might produce some effect on the public.
MABEL CHILTERN.; But he does it in a horrid confidential way.
MABEL CHILTERN.; When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am very fond of Tommy, but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wish, Gertrude, you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a manner that attracts some attention. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Dear Mabel, don’t talk like that.
LADY CHILTERN.; Besides, Robert thinks very highly of Mr. Trafford.
LADY CHILTERN.; He believes he has a brilliant future before him. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wouldn’t marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I know, dear.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You married a man with a future, didn’t you?
MABEL CHILTERN.; But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble, self-sacrificing character.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You can stand geniuses.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have no character at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.
MABEL CHILTERN.; As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Geniuses talk so much, don’t they?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Such a bad habit!
MABEL CHILTERN.; And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be thinking about me.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I must go round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon’s.
MABEL CHILTERN.; You remember, we are having tableaux, don’t you?
MABEL CHILTERN.; The Triumph of something, I don’t know what!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I hope it will be triumph of me.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Only triumph I am really interested in at present.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Oh, Gertrude, do you know who is coming to see you?
MABEL CHILTERN.; That dreadful Mrs. Cheveley, in a most lovely gown.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Did you ask her? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Mrs. Cheveley!
LADY CHILTERN.; Coming to see me?
LADY CHILTERN.; Impossible! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life and not nearly so natural. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You need not wait, Mabel.
LADY CHILTERN.; Remember, Lady Basildon is expecting you. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I must shake hands with Lady Markby.
MABEL CHILTERN.; She is delightful.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I love being scolded by her. 
MASON.;   Lady Markby.
MASON.; Mrs. Cheveley. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Dear Lady Markby, how nice of you to come and see me!
LADY CHILTERN.; Won’t you sit down, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Isn’t that Miss Chiltern?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I should like so much to know her. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Mabel, Mrs. Cheveley wishes to know you. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I thought your frock so charming last night, Miss Chiltern.
MRS CHEVELEY.; So simple and .
MRS CHEVELEY.; suitable. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Really?
MABEL CHILTERN.; I must tell my dressmaker.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It will be such a surprise to her.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Good-bye, Lady Markby! 
LADY MARKBY.;   Going already? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I am so sorry but I am obliged to.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am just off to rehearsal.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have got to stand on my head in some tableaux. 
LADY MARKBY.;   On your head, child?
LADY MARKBY.; Oh!
LADY MARKBY.; I hope not.
LADY MARKBY.; I believe it is most unhealthy.   
MABEL CHILTERN.;   But it is for an excellent charity: in aid of the Undeserving, the only people I am really interested in.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am the secretary, and Tommy Trafford is treasurer. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   And what is Lord Goring? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Lord Goring is president. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   The post should suit him admirably, unless he has deteriorated since I knew him first. 
LADY MARKBY.;     You are remarkably modern, Mabel.
LADY MARKBY.; A little too modern, perhaps.
LADY MARKBY.; Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern.
LADY MARKBY.; One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.
LADY MARKBY.; I have known many instances of it. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   What a dreadful prospect! 
LADY MARKBY.;   Ah!
LADY MARKBY.; my dear, you need not be nervous.
LADY MARKBY.; You will always be as pretty as possible.
LADY MARKBY.; That is the best fashion there is, and the only fashion that England succeeds in setting. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Thank you so much, Lady Markby, for England .
MABEL CHILTERN.; and myself.   
LADY MARKBY.;     Dear Gertrude, we just called to know if Mrs. Cheveley’s diamond brooch has been found. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Here? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I missed it when I got back to Claridge’s, and I thought I might possibly have dropped it here. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I have heard nothing about it.
LADY CHILTERN.; But I will send for the butler and ask.   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, pray don’t trouble, Lady Chiltern.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I dare say I lost it at the Opera, before we came on here. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Ah yes, I suppose it must have been at the Opera.
LADY MARKBY.; The fact is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that I wonder we have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.
LADY MARKBY.; I know myself that, when I am coming back from the Drawing Room, I always feel as if I hadn’t a shred on me, except a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows of the carriage.
LADY MARKBY.; The fact is that our Society is terribly over-populated.
LADY MARKBY.; Really, some one should arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration.
LADY MARKBY.; It would do a great deal of good. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is nearly six years since I have been in London for the Season, and I must say Society has become dreadfully mixed.
MRS CHEVELEY.; One sees the oddest people everywhere. 
LADY MARKBY.;   That is quite true, dear.
LADY MARKBY.; But one needn’t know them.
LADY MARKBY.; I’m sure I don’t know half the people who come to my house.
LADY MARKBY.; Indeed, from all I hear, I shouldn’t like to. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby. 
LADY MARKBY.;   I thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   No, lady Markby—a ruby. 
LADY MARKBY.;     And very becoming, I am quite sure. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the rooms this morning, Mason? 
MASON.;   No, my lady. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Oh, it has been no inconvenience.
LADY CHILTERN.; That will do, Mason.
LADY CHILTERN.; You can bring tea. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Well, I must say it is most annoying to lose anything.
LADY MARKBY.; I remember once at Bath, years ago, losing in the Pump Room an exceedingly handsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me.
LADY MARKBY.; I don’t think he has ever given me anything since, I am sorry to say.
LADY MARKBY.; He has sadly degenerated.
LADY MARKBY.; Really, this horrid House of Commons quite ruins our husbands for us.
LADY MARKBY.; I think the Lower House by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called the Higher Education of Women was invented. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Ah!
LADY CHILTERN.; it is heresy to say that in this house, Lady Markby.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert is a great champion of the Higher Education of Women, and so, I am afraid, am I. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   The higher education of men is what I should like to see.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Men need it so sadly. 
LADY MARKBY.;   They do, dear.
LADY MARKBY.; But I am afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical.
LADY MARKBY.; I don’t think man has much capacity for development.
LADY MARKBY.; He has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?
LADY MARKBY.; With regard to women, well, dear Gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and I am sure it is all right if you approve of it.
LADY MARKBY.; In my time, of course, we were taught not to understand anything.
LADY MARKBY.; That was the old system, and wonderfully interesting it was.
LADY MARKBY.; I assure you that the amount of things I and my poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite extraordinary.
LADY MARKBY.; But modern women understand everything, I am told. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Except their husbands.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is the one thing the modern woman never understands. 
LADY MARKBY.;   And a very good thing too, dear, I dare say.
LADY MARKBY.; It might break up many a happy home if they did.
LADY MARKBY.; Not yours, I need hardly say, Gertrude.
LADY MARKBY.; You have married a pattern husband.
LADY MARKBY.; I wish I could say as much for myself.
LADY MARKBY.; But since Sir John has taken to attending the debates regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language has become quite impossible.
LADY MARKBY.; He always seems to think that he is addressing the House, and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of the room.
LADY MARKBY.; It is not pleasant to see one’s own butler, who has been with one for twenty-three years, actually blushing at the side-board, and the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses.
LADY MARKBY.; I assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send John at once to the Upper House.
LADY MARKBY.; He won’t take any interest in politics then, will he?
LADY MARKBY.; The House of Lords is so sensible.
LADY MARKBY.; An assembly of gentlemen.
LADY MARKBY.; But in his present state, Sir John is really a great trial.
LADY MARKBY.; Why, this morning before breakfast was half over, he stood up on the hearthrug, put his hands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the top of his voice.
LADY MARKBY.; I left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, I need hardly say.
LADY MARKBY.; But his violent language could be heard all over the house!
LADY MARKBY.; I trust, Gertrude, that Sir Robert is not like that? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   But I am very much interested in politics, Lady Markby.
LADY CHILTERN.; I love to hear Robert talk about them. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Well, I hope he is not as devoted to Blue Books as Sir John is.
LADY MARKBY.; I don’t think they can be quite improving reading for any one. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I have never read a Blue Book.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I prefer books .
MRS CHEVELEY.; in yellow covers. 
LADY MARKBY.;     Yellow is a gayer colour, is it not?
LADY MARKBY.; I used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and would do so now if Sir John was not so painfully personal in his observations, and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh, no!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I think men are the only authorities on dress. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Really?
LADY MARKBY.; One wouldn’t say so from the sort of hats they wear?
LADY MARKBY.; would one? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   May I give you some tea, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks.   
LADY CHILTERN.;   Some tea, Lady Markby? 
LADY MARKBY.;   No thanks, dear.
LADY MARKBY.; The fact is, I have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor Lady Brancaster, who is in very great trouble.
LADY MARKBY.; Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up girl, too, has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in Shropshire.
LADY MARKBY.; It is very sad, very sad indeed.
LADY MARKBY.; I can’t understand this modern mania for curates.
LADY MARKBY.; In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like rabbits.
LADY MARKBY.; But we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say.
LADY MARKBY.; But I am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with them.
LADY MARKBY.; I think it most irreligious.
LADY MARKBY.; And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord Brancaster always hides himself behind the money article in _The Times_.
LADY MARKBY.; However, I believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _The Times_ at all the clubs in St. James’s Street; there are so many sons who won’t have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who won’t speak to their sons.
LADY MARKBY.; I think myself, it is very much to be regretted. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   So do I.  Fathers have so much to learn from their sons nowadays. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Really, dear?
LADY MARKBY.; What? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   The art of living.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The only really Fine Art we have produced in modern times. 
LADY MARKBY.;     Ah!
LADY MARKBY.; I am afraid Lord Brancaster knew a good deal about that.
LADY MARKBY.; More than his poor wife ever did.
LADY MARKBY.; You know Lady Brancaster, don’t you, dear? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Just slightly.
LADY CHILTERN.; She was staying at Langton last autumn, when we were there. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of happiness, as no doubt you noticed.
LADY MARKBY.; But there are many tragedies in her family, besides this affair of the curate.
LADY MARKBY.; Her own sister, Mrs. Jekyll, had a most unhappy life; through no fault of her own, I am sorry to say.
LADY MARKBY.; She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.
LADY MARKBY.; No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.
LADY MARKBY.; I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.
LADY MARKBY.; And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.
LADY MARKBY.; Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn’t mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.
LADY MARKBY.; As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I shan’t stay long. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Well, I hear the curate is always prowling about the house. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I am afraid I am not fond of girl friends. 
LADY CHILTERN   Oh, I hope Mrs.;  Cheveley will stay here a little.
LADY CHILTERN   Oh, I hope Mrs.; I should like to have a few minutes’ conversation with her. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   How very kind of you, Lady Chiltern!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Believe me, nothing would give me greater pleasure. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Ah!
LADY MARKBY.; no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of your schooldays to talk over together.
LADY MARKBY.; Good-bye, dear Gertrude!
LADY MARKBY.; Shall I see you at Lady Bonar’s to-night?
LADY MARKBY.; She has discovered a wonderful new genius.
LADY MARKBY.; He does .
LADY MARKBY.; .
LADY MARKBY.; .
LADY MARKBY.; nothing at all, I believe.
LADY MARKBY.; That is a great comfort, is it not? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert and I are dining at home by ourselves to-night, and I don’t think I shall go anywhere afterwards.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, of course, will have to be in the House.
LADY CHILTERN.; But there is nothing interesting on. 
LADY MARKBY.;   Dining at home by yourselves?
LADY MARKBY.; Is that quite prudent?
LADY MARKBY.; Ah, I forgot, your husband is an exception.
LADY MARKBY.; Mine is the general rule, and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn’t she?
MRS CHEVELEY.; Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met.
MRS CHEVELEY.; She is made to be a public speaker.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Much more so than her husband, though he is a typical Englishman, always dull and usually violent. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who you really were, I should not have invited you to my house last night. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Really? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I could not have done so. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I see that after all these years you have not changed a bit, Gertrude. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I never change. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Then life has taught you nothing? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Would you apply that rule to every one? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes, to every one, without exception. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any further acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite impossible? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Do you know, Gertrude, I don’t mind your talking morality a bit.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You dislike me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am quite aware of that.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And I have always detested you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And yet I have come here to do you a service. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Like the service you wished to render my husband last night, I suppose.
LADY CHILTERN.; Thank heaven, I saved him from that. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     It was you who made him write that insolent letter to me?
MRS CHEVELEY.; It was you who made him break his promise? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Then you must make him keep it.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I give you till to-morrow morning—no more.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If by that time your husband does not solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am interested— 
LADY CHILTERN.;   This fraudulent speculation— 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Call it what you choose.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I hold your husband in the hollow of my hand, and if you are wise you will make him do what I tell him. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     You are impertinent.
LADY CHILTERN.; What has my husband to do with you?
LADY CHILTERN.; With a woman like you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   In this world like meets with like.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we pair so well together.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Between you and him there are chasms.
MRS CHEVELEY.; He and I are closer than friends.
MRS CHEVELEY.; We are enemies linked together.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The same sin binds us. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   How dare you class my husband with yourself?
LADY CHILTERN.; How dare you threaten him or me?
LADY CHILTERN.; Leave my house.
LADY CHILTERN.; You are unfit to enter it. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Your house!
MRS CHEVELEY.; A house bought with the price of dishonour.
MRS CHEVELEY.; A house, everything in which has been paid for by fraud.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Ask him what the origin of his fortune is!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Learn from him to what you owe your position. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   It is not true!
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert!
LADY CHILTERN.; It is not true! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Look at him!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Can he deny it?
MRS CHEVELEY.; Does he dare to? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Go!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Go at once.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You have done your worst now. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   My worst?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have not yet finished with you, with either of you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I give you both till to-morrow at noon.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If by then you don’t do what I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of Robert Chiltern. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Show Mrs. Cheveley out. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You sold a Cabinet secret for money!
LADY CHILTERN.; You began your life with fraud!
LADY CHILTERN.; You built up your career on dishonour!
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh, tell me it is not true!
LADY CHILTERN.; Lie to me!
LADY CHILTERN.; Lie to me!
LADY CHILTERN.; Tell me it is not true! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What this woman said is quite true.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But, Gertrude, listen to me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You don’t realise how I was tempted.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Let me tell you the whole thing.  
LADY CHILTERN.;   Don’t come near me.
LADY CHILTERN.; Don’t touch me.
LADY CHILTERN.; I feel as if you had soiled me for ever.
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; what a mask you have been wearing all these years!
LADY CHILTERN.; A horrible painted mask!
LADY CHILTERN.; You sold yourself for money.
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; a common thief were better.
LADY CHILTERN.; You put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder!
LADY CHILTERN.; You were bought in the market.
LADY CHILTERN.; You lied to the whole world.
LADY CHILTERN.; And yet you will not lie to me. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Gertrude!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Gertrude! 
LADY CHILTERN.;     No, don’t speak!
LADY CHILTERN.; Say nothing!
LADY CHILTERN.; Your voice wakes terrible memories—memories of things that made me love you—memories of words that made me love you—memories that now are horrible to me.
LADY CHILTERN.; And how I worshipped you!
LADY CHILTERN.; You were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest, without stain.
LADY CHILTERN.; The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and goodness more real because you lived.
LADY CHILTERN.; And now—oh, when I think that I made of a man like you my ideal!
LADY CHILTERN.; the ideal of my life! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   There was your mistake.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There was your error.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The error all women commit.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Why can’t you women love us, faults and all?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that reason.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us—else what use is love at all?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; A man’s love is like that.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is wider, larger, more human than a woman’s.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Women think that they are making ideals of men.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What they are making of us are false idols merely.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And so, last night you ruined my life for me—yes, ruined it!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She offered security, peace, stability.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its record, burned the one witness against me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You prevented me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; No one but you, you know it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Let women make no more ideals of men!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; let them not put them on alters and bow before them, or they may ruin other lives as completely as you—you whom I have so wildly loved—have ruined mine! 
LORD GORING.;   Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps? 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord.   
LORD GORING.;   Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.
LORD GORING.; I am the only person of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord.
PHIPPS.; I have observed that, 
LORD GORING.;     You see, Phipps, Fashion is what one wears oneself.
LORD GORING.; What is unfashionable is what other people wear. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;     And falsehoods the truths of other people. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Other people are quite dreadful.
LORD GORING.; The only possible society is oneself. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance, Phipps. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;     Don’t think I quite like this buttonhole, Phipps.
LORD GORING.; Makes me look a little too old.
LORD GORING.; Makes me almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps? 
PHIPPS.;   I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance. 
LORD GORING.;   You don’t, Phipps? 
PHIPPS.;   No, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   I am not quite sure.
LORD GORING.; For the future a more trivial buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings. 
PHIPPS.;   I will speak to the florist, my lord.
PHIPPS.; She has had a loss in her family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your lordship complains of in the buttonhole. 
LORD GORING.;   Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they are always losing their relations. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord!
PHIPPS.; They are extremely fortunate in that respect. 
LORD GORING.;     Hum!
LORD GORING.; Any letters, Phipps? 
PHIPPS.;   Three, my lord.   
LORD GORING.;     Want my cab round in twenty minutes. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord.   
LORD GORING.;     Ahem!
LORD GORING.; Phipps, when did this letter arrive? 
PHIPPS.;   It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the club. 
LORD GORING.;   That will do.
LORD GORING.; Lady Chiltern’s handwriting on Lady Chiltern’s pink notepaper.
LORD GORING.; That is rather curious.
LORD GORING.; I thought Robert was to write.
LORD GORING.; Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say to me?
LORD GORING.; ‘I want you.
LORD GORING.; I trust you.
LORD GORING.; I am coming to you.
LORD GORING.; Gertrude.’    ‘I want you.
LORD GORING.; I trust you.
LORD GORING.; I am coming to you.’  So she has found out everything!
LORD GORING.; Poor woman!
LORD GORING.; Poor woman!
LORD GORING.; But what an hour to call!
LORD GORING.; Ten o’clock!
LORD GORING.; I shall have to give up going to the Berkshires.
LORD GORING.; However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.
LORD GORING.; I am not expected at the Bachelors’, so I shall certainly go there.
LORD GORING.; Well, I will make her stand by her husband.
LORD GORING.; That is the only thing for her to do.
LORD GORING.; That is the only thing for any woman to do.
LORD GORING.; It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.
LORD GORING.; Ten o’clock.
LORD GORING.; She should be here soon.
LORD GORING.; I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else. 
PHIPPS.;   Lord Caversham. 
LORD GORING.;   Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?
LORD GORING.; Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.
LORD GORING.; Delighted to see you, my dear father.   
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Take my cloak off. 
LORD GORING.;   Is it worth while, father? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Of course it is worth while, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Which is the most comfortable chair? 
LORD GORING.;   This one, father.
LORD GORING.; It is the chair I use myself, when I have visitors. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Thank ye.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; No draught, I hope, in this room? 
LORD GORING.;   No, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     Glad to hear it.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Can’t stand draughts.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; No draughts at home. 
LORD GORING.;   Good many breezes, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Eh?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Eh?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Don’t understand what you mean.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Want to have a serious conversation with you, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   My dear father!
LORD GORING.; At this hour? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, sir, it is only ten o’clock.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; What is your objection to the hour?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I think the hour is an admirable hour! 
LORD GORING.;   Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking seriously.
LORD GORING.; I am very sorry, but it is not my day. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What do you mean, sir? 
LORD GORING.;   During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday. 
LORD GORING.;   But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must not have any serious conversation after seven.
LORD GORING.; It makes me talk in my sleep. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Talk in your sleep, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; What does that matter?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You are not married. 
LORD GORING.;   No, father, I am not married. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Hum!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; That is what I have come to talk to you about, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You have got to get married, and at once.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Why, when I was your age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Damme, sir, it is your duty to get married.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You can’t be always living for pleasure.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Every man of position is married nowadays.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Bachelors are not fashionable any more.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; They are a damaged lot.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Too much is known about them.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You must get a wife, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Why don’t you imitate him, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Why don’t you take him for your model? 
LORD GORING.;   I think I shall, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I wish you would, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Then I should be happy.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; At present I make your mother’s life miserable on your account.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You are heartless, sir, quite heartless. 
LORD GORING.;   I hope not, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   And it is high time for you to get married.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You are thirty-four years of age, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes, father, but I only admit to thirty-two—thirty-one and a half when I have a really good buttonhole.
LORD GORING.; This buttonhole is not .
LORD GORING.; trivial enough. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I tell you you are thirty-four, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; And there is a draught in your room, besides, which makes your conduct worse.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Why did you tell me there was no draught, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I feel a draught, sir, I feel it distinctly. 
LORD GORING.;   So do I, father.
LORD GORING.; It is a dreadful draught.
LORD GORING.; I will come and see you to-morrow, father.
LORD GORING.; We can talk over anything you like.
LORD GORING.; Let me help you on with your cloak, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite purpose, and I am going to see it through at all costs to my health or yours.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Put down my cloak, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly, father.
LORD GORING.; But let us go into another room.
LORD GORING.; There is a dreadful draught here.
LORD GORING.; Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room? 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Come in there, father.
LORD GORING.; Your sneezes are quite heartrending. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, sir, I suppose I have a right to sneeze when I choose? 
LORD GORING.;     Quite so, father.
LORD GORING.; I was merely expressing sympathy. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Oh, damn sympathy.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; There is a great deal too much of that sort of thing going on nowadays. 
LORD GORING.;   I quite agree with you, father.
LORD GORING.; If there was less sympathy in the world there would be less trouble in the world. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     That is a paradox, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I hate paradoxes. 
LORD GORING.;   So do I, father.
LORD GORING.; Everybody one meets is a paradox nowadays.
LORD GORING.; It is a great bore.
LORD GORING.; It makes society so obvious. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     Do you always really understand what you say, sir? 
LORD GORING.;     Yes, father, if I listen attentively. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     If you listen attentively!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Conceited young puppy! 
LORD GORING.;   Phipps, there is a lady coming to see me this evening on particular business.
LORD GORING.; Show her into the drawing-room when she arrives.
LORD GORING.; You understand? 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   It is a matter of the gravest importance, Phipps. 
PHIPPS.;   I understand, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   No one else is to be admitted, under any circumstances. 
PHIPPS.;   I understand, my lord.   
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; that is probably the lady.
LORD GORING.; I shall see her myself. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; am I to wait attendance on you? 
LORD GORING.;     In a moment, father.
LORD GORING.; Do excuse me.
LORD GORING.; Well, remember my instructions, Phipps—into that room. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
HAROLD.;   What name, madam? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Is Lord Goring not here?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I was told he was at home? 
PHIPPS.;   His lordship is engaged at present with Lord Caversham, madam. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     How very filial! 
PHIPPS.;   His lordship told me to ask you, madam, to be kind enough to wait in the drawing-room for him.
PHIPPS.; His lordship will come to you there. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Lord Goring expects me? 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, madam. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Are you quite sure? 
PHIPPS.;   His lordship told me that if a lady called I was to ask her to wait in the drawing-room.
PHIPPS.; His lordship’s directions on the subject were very precise. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     How thoughtful of him!
MRS CHEVELEY.; To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Ugh!
MRS CHEVELEY.; How dreary a bachelor’s drawing-room always looks.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I shall have to alter all this.
MRS CHEVELEY.; No, I don’t care for that lamp.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is far too glaring.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Light some candles. 
PHIPPS.;     Certainly, madam. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I hope the candles have very becoming shades. 
PHIPPS.;   We have had no complaints about them, madam, as yet. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I wonder what woman he is waiting for to-night.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It will be delightful to catch him.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Men always look so silly when they are caught.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And they are always being caught.
MRS CHEVELEY.; What a very interesting room!
MRS CHEVELEY.; What a very interesting picture!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Wonder what his correspondence is like.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Oh, what a very uninteresting correspondence!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Bills and cards, debts and dowagers!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Who on earth writes to him on pink paper?
MRS CHEVELEY.; How silly to write on pink paper!
MRS CHEVELEY.; It looks like the beginning of a middle-class romance.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Romance should never begin with sentiment.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It should begin with science and end with a settlement.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I know that handwriting.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is Gertrude Chiltern’s.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I remember it perfectly.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The ten commandments in every stroke of the pen, and the moral law all over the page.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Wonder what Gertrude is writing to him about?
MRS CHEVELEY.; Something horrid about me, I suppose.
MRS CHEVELEY.; How I detest that woman!
MRS CHEVELEY.; ‘I trust you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am coming to you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Gertrude.’  ‘I trust you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am coming to you.’ 
PHIPPS.;   The candles in the drawing-room are lit, madam, as you directed. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thank you.   
PHIPPS.;   I trust the shades will be to your liking, madam.
PHIPPS.; They are the most becoming we have.
PHIPPS.; They are the same as his lordship uses himself when he is dressing for dinner. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Then I am sure they will be perfectly right. 
PHIPPS.;     Thank you, madam. 
LORD GORING.;     My dear father, if I am to get married, surely you will allow me to choose the time, place, and person?
LORD GORING.; Particularly the person. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     That is a matter for me, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You would probably make a very poor choice.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; It is I who should be consulted, not you.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; There is property at stake.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; It is not a matter for affection.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Affection comes later on in married life. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes.
LORD GORING.; In married life affection comes when people thoroughly dislike each other, father, doesn’t it?   
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Certainly, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I mean certainly not, air.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You are talking very foolishly to-night.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; What I say is that marriage is a matter for common sense. 
LORD GORING.;   But women who have common sense are so curiously plain, father, aren’t they?
LORD GORING.; Of course I only speak from hearsay. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   No woman, plain or pretty, has any common sense at all, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Common sense is the privilege of our sex. 
LORD GORING.;   Quite so.
LORD GORING.; And we men are so self-sacrificing that we never use it, do we, father? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I use it, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I use nothing else. 
LORD GORING.;   So my mother tells me. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   It is the secret of your mother’s happiness.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You are very heartless, sir, very heartless. 
LORD GORING.;   I hope not, father. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   My dear Arthur, what a piece of good luck meeting you on the doorstep!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Your servant had just told me you were not at home.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; How extraordinary! 
LORD GORING.;   The fact is, I am horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I gave orders I was not at home to any one.
LORD GORING.; Even my father had a comparatively cold reception.
LORD GORING.; He complained of a draught the whole time. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Ah!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; you must be at home to me, Arthur.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You are my best friend.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Perhaps by to-morrow you will be my only friend.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; My wife has discovered everything. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; I guessed as much! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Really!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; How? 
LORD GORING.;     Oh, merely by something in the expression of your face as you came in.
LORD GORING.; Who told her? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Mrs. Cheveley herself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And the woman I love knows that I began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that I built up my life upon sands of shame—that I sold, like a common huckster, the secret that had been intrusted to me as a man of honour.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I thank heaven poor Lord Radley died without knowing that I betrayed him.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I would to God I had died before I had been so horribly tempted, or had fallen so low. 
LORD GORING.;     You have heard nothing from Vienna yet, in answer to your wire? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Yes; I got a telegram from the first secretary at eight o’clock to-night. 
LORD GORING.;   Well? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Nothing is absolutely known against her.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; On the contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is a sort of open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion of his immense fortune.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Beyond that I can learn nothing. 
LORD GORING.;   She doesn’t turn out to be a spy, then? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; spies are of no use nowadays.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Their profession is over.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The newspapers do their work instead. 
LORD GORING.;   And thunderingly well they do it. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Arthur, I am parched with thirst.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; May I ring for something?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Some hock and seltzer? 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly.
LORD GORING.; Let me.   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Thanks!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I don’t know what to do, Arthur, I don’t know what to do, and you are my only friend.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But what a friend you are—the one friend I can trust.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I can trust you absolutely, can’t I? 
LORD GORING.;   My dear Robert, of course.
LORD GORING.; Oh!
LORD GORING.; Bring some hock and seltzer. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   And Phipps! 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Will you excuse me for a moment, Robert?
LORD GORING.; I want to give some directions to my servant. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Certainly. 
LORD GORING.;   When that lady calls, tell her that I am not expected home this evening.
LORD GORING.; Tell her that I have been suddenly called out of town.
LORD GORING.; You understand? 
PHIPPS.;   The lady is in that room, my lord.
PHIPPS.; You told me to show her into that room, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   You did perfectly right.
LORD GORING.; What a mess I am in.
LORD GORING.; No; I think I shall get through it.
LORD GORING.; I’ll give her a lecture through the door.
LORD GORING.; Awkward thing to manage, though. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Arthur, tell me what I should do.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; My life seems to have crumbled about me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am a ship without a rudder in a night without a star. 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, you love your wife, don’t you? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I love her more than anything in the world.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I used to think ambition the great thing.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It is not.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Love is the great thing in the world.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There is nothing but love, and I love her.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But I am defamed in her eyes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am ignoble in her eyes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There is a wide gulf between us now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She has found me out, Arthur, she has found me out. 
LORD GORING.;   Has she never in her life done some folly—some indiscretion—that she should not forgive your sin? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   My wife!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Never!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She does not know what weakness or temptation is.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am of clay like other men.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She stands apart as good women do—pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But I love her, Arthur.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; We are childless, and I have no one else to love, no one else to love me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Perhaps if God had sent us children she might have been kinder to me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But God has given us a lonely house.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And she has cut my heart in two.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Don’t let us talk of it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I was brutal to her this evening.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But I suppose when sinners talk to saints they are brutal always.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I said to her things that were hideously true, on my side, from my stand-point, from the standpoint of men.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But don’t let us talk of that. 
LORD GORING.;   Your wife will forgive you.
LORD GORING.; Perhaps at this moment she is forgiving you.
LORD GORING.; She loves you, Robert.
LORD GORING.; Why should she not forgive? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   God grant it!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; God grant it!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But there is something more I have to tell you, Arthur. 
PHIPPS.;     Hock and seltzer, sir. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Thank you. 
LORD GORING.;   Is your carriage here, Robert? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   No; I walked from the club. 
LORD GORING.;   Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps. 
PHIPPS.;   Yes, my lord.   
LORD GORING.;   Robert, you don’t mind my sending you away? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What is that? 
LORD GORING.;   Nothing. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I heard a chair fall in the next room.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Some one has been listening. 
LORD GORING.;   No, no; there is no one there. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   There is some one.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There are lights in the room, and the door is ajar.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Some one has been listening to every secret of my life.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, what does this mean? 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, you are excited, unnerved.
LORD GORING.; I tell you there is no one in that room.
LORD GORING.; Sit down, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Do you give me your word that there is no one there? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Your word of honour?   
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Arthur, let me see for myself. 
LORD GORING.;   No, no. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   If there is no one there why should I not look in that room?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life’s secret.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, you don’t realise what I am going through. 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, this must stop.
LORD GORING.; I have told you that there is no one in that room—that is enough. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     It is not enough.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I insist on going into this room.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You have told me there is no one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me? 
LORD GORING.;   For God’s sake, don’t!
LORD GORING.; There is some one there.
LORD GORING.; Some one whom you must not see. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Ah, I thought so! 
LORD GORING.;   I forbid you to enter that room. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Stand back.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; My life is at stake.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And I don’t care who is there.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I will know who it is to whom I have told my secret and my shame.   
LORD GORING.;   Great heavens!
LORD GORING.; his own wife! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What explanation have you to give me for the presence of that woman here? 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   She is a vile, an infamous thing! 
LORD GORING.;   Don’t say that, Robert!
LORD GORING.; It was for your sake she came here.
LORD GORING.; It was to try and save you she came here.
LORD GORING.; She loves you and no one else. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You are mad.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; What have I to do with her intrigues with you?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Let her remain your mistress!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You are well suited to each other.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; She, corrupt and shameful—you, false as a friend, treacherous as an enemy even— 
LORD GORING.;   It is not true, Robert.
LORD GORING.; Before heaven, it is not true.
LORD GORING.; In her presence and in yours I will explain all. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Let me pass, sir.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You have lied enough upon your word of honour. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Good evening, Lord Goring! 
LORD GORING.;   Mrs. Cheveley!
LORD GORING.; Great heavens!
LORD GORING.; May I ask what you were doing in my drawing-room? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Merely listening.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have a perfect passion for listening through keyholes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; One always hears such wonderful things through them. 
LORD GORING.;   Doesn’t that sound rather like tempting Providence? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh!
MRS CHEVELEY.; surely Providence can resist temptation by this time. 
LORD GORING.;   I am glad you have called.
LORD GORING.; I am going to give you some good advice. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Oh!
MRS CHEVELEY.; pray don’t.
MRS CHEVELEY.; One should never give a woman anything that she can’t wear in the evening. 
LORD GORING.;   I see you are quite as wilful as you used to be. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Far more!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have greatly improved.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have had more experience. 
LORD GORING.;   Too much experience is a dangerous thing.
LORD GORING.; Pray have a cigarette.
LORD GORING.; Half the pretty women in London smoke cigarettes.
LORD GORING.; Personally I prefer the other half. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I never smoke.
MRS CHEVELEY.; My dressmaker wouldn’t like it, and a woman’s first duty in life is to her dressmaker, isn’t it?
MRS CHEVELEY.; What the second duty is, no one has as yet discovered. 
LORD GORING.;   You have come here to sell me Robert Chiltern’s letter, haven’t you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   To offer it to you on conditions.
MRS CHEVELEY.; How did you guess that? 
LORD GORING.;   Because you haven’t mentioned the subject.
LORD GORING.; Have you got it with you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Oh, no!
MRS CHEVELEY.; A well-made dress has no pockets. 
LORD GORING.;   What is your price for it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   How absurdly English you are!
MRS CHEVELEY.; The English think that a cheque-book can solve every problem in life.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Why, my dear Arthur, I have very much more money than you have, and quite as much as Robert Chiltern has got hold of.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Money is not what I want. 
LORD GORING.;   What do you want then, Mrs. Cheveley? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Why don’t you call me Laura? 
LORD GORING.;   I don’t like the name. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You used to adore it. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes: that’s why.   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Arthur, you loved me once. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   And you asked me to be your wife. 
LORD GORING.;   That was the natural result of my loving you. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   And you threw me over because you saw, or said you saw, poor old Lord Mortlake trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the conservatory at Tenby. 
LORD GORING.;   I am under the impression that my lawyer settled that matter with you on certain terms .
LORD GORING.; dictated by yourself. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   At that time I was poor; you were rich. 
LORD GORING.;   Quite so.
LORD GORING.; That is why you pretended to love me. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Poor old Lord Mortlake, who had only two topics of conversation, his gout and his wife!
MRS CHEVELEY.; I never could quite make out which of the two he was talking about.
MRS CHEVELEY.; He used the most horrible language about them both.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Well, you were silly, Arthur.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Why, Lord Mortlake was never anything more to me than an amusement.
MRS CHEVELEY.; One of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an English country house on an English country Sunday.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I don’t think any one at all morally responsible for what he or she does at an English country house. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes.
LORD GORING.; I know lots of people think that. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I loved you, Arthur. 
LORD GORING.;   My dear Mrs. Cheveley, you have always been far too clever to know anything about love. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I did love you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And you loved me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You know you loved me; and love is a very wonderful thing.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I suppose that when a man has once loved a woman, he will do anything for her, except continue to love her?   
LORD GORING.;     Yes: except that. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I am tired of living abroad.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want to come back to London.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want to have a charming house here.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I want to have a salon.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilised.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Besides, I have arrived at the romantic stage.
MRS CHEVELEY.; When I saw you last night at the Chilterns’, I knew you were the only person I had ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, Arthur.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And so, on the morning of the day you marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern’s letter.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is my offer.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I will give it to you now, if you promise to marry me. 
LORD GORING.;   Now? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     To-morrow. 
LORD GORING.;   Are you really serious? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes, quite serious. 
LORD GORING.;   I should make you a very bad husband. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I don’t mind bad husbands.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I have had two.
MRS CHEVELEY.; They amused me immensely. 
LORD GORING.;   You mean that you amused yourself immensely, don’t you? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   What do you know about my married life? 
LORD GORING.;   Nothing: but I can read it like a book. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   What book? 
LORD GORING.;     The Book of Numbers. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to a woman in your own house? 
LORD GORING.;   In the case of very fascinating women, sex is a challenge, not a defence. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I suppose that is meant for a compliment.
MRS CHEVELEY.; My dear Arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Men always are.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is the difference between the two sexes. 
LORD GORING.;   Women are never disarmed by anything, as far as I know them. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Then you are going to allow your greatest friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some one who really has considerable attractions left.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I thought you would have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, Arthur.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I think you should.
MRS CHEVELEY.; And the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your own perfections. 
LORD GORING.;   Oh!
LORD GORING.; I do that as it is.
LORD GORING.; And self-sacrifice is a thing that should be put down by law.
LORD GORING.; It is so demoralising to the people for whom one sacrifices oneself.
LORD GORING.; They always go to the bad. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   As if anything could demoralise Robert Chiltern!
MRS CHEVELEY.; You seem to forget that I know his real character. 
LORD GORING.;   What you know about him is not his real character.
LORD GORING.; It was an act of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, I admit, shameful, I admit, unworthy of him, I admit, and therefore .
LORD GORING.; not his true character. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   How you men stand up for each other! 
LORD GORING.;   How you women war against each other! 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I only war against one woman, against Gertrude Chiltern.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I hate her.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I hate her now more than ever. 
LORD GORING.;   Because you have brought a real tragedy into her life, I suppose. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Oh, there is only one real tragedy in a woman’s life.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The fact that her past is always her lover, and her future invariably her husband. 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern knows nothing of the kind of life to which you are alluding. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   A woman whose size in gloves is seven and three-quarters never knows much about anything.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You know Gertrude has always worn seven and three-quarters?
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is one of the reasons why there was never any moral sympathy between us.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Well, Arthur, I suppose this romantic interview may be regarded as at an end.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You admit it was romantic, don’t you?
MRS CHEVELEY.; For the privilege of being your wife I was ready to surrender a great prize, the climax of my diplomatic career.
MRS CHEVELEY.; You decline.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Very well.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If Sir Robert doesn’t uphold my Argentine scheme, I expose him.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Voilà tout. 
LORD GORING.;   You mustn’t do that.
LORD GORING.; It would be vile, horrible, infamous. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Oh!
MRS CHEVELEY.; don’t use big words.
MRS CHEVELEY.; They mean so little.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It is a commercial transaction.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That is all.
MRS CHEVELEY.; There is no good mixing up sentimentality in it.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I offered to sell Robert Chiltern a certain thing.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If he won’t pay me my price, he will have to pay the world a greater price.
MRS CHEVELEY.; There is no more to be said.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I must go.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Good-bye.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Won’t you shake hands? 
LORD GORING.;   With you?
LORD GORING.; No.
LORD GORING.; Your transaction with Robert Chiltern may pass as a loathsome commercial transaction of a loathsome commercial age; but you seem to have forgotten that you came here to-night to talk of love, you whose lips desecrated the word love, you to whom the thing is a book closely sealed, went this afternoon to the house of one of the most noble and gentle women in the world to degrade her husband in her eyes, to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and bitterness in her life, to break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her soul.
LORD GORING.; That I cannot forgive you.
LORD GORING.; That was horrible.
LORD GORING.; For that there can be no forgiveness. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Arthur, you are unjust to me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Believe me, you are quite unjust to me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I didn’t go to taunt Gertrude at all.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I had no idea of doing anything of the kind when I entered.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I called with Lady Markby simply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that I lost somewhere last night, had been found at the Chilterns’.
MRS CHEVELEY.; If you don’t believe me, you can ask Lady Markby.
MRS CHEVELEY.; She will tell you it is true.
MRS CHEVELEY.; The scene that occurred happened after Lady Markby had left, and was really forced on me by Gertrude’s rudeness and sneers.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I called, oh!—a little out of malice if you like—but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been found.
MRS CHEVELEY.; That was the origin of the whole thing. 
LORD GORING.;   A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; How do you know? 
LORD GORING.;   Because it is found.
LORD GORING.; In point of fact, I found it myself, and stupidly forgot to tell the butler anything about it as I was leaving.
LORD GORING.; It is in this drawer.
LORD GORING.; No, that one.
LORD GORING.; This is the brooch, isn’t it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am so glad to get it back.
MRS CHEVELEY.; It was .
MRS CHEVELEY.; a present. 
LORD GORING.;   Won’t you wear it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Certainly, if you pin it in.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Why do you put it on as a bracelet?
MRS CHEVELEY.; I never knew it could he worn as a bracelet. 
LORD GORING.;   Really? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     No; but it looks very well on me as a bracelet, doesn’t it? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes; much better than when I saw it last. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   When did you see it last? 
LORD GORING.;     Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     What do you mean? 
LORD GORING.;   I mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, Mary Berkshire, to whom I gave it when she was married.
LORD GORING.; Suspicion fell on a wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace.
LORD GORING.; I recognised it last night.
LORD GORING.; I determined to say nothing about it till I had found the thief.
LORD GORING.; I have found the thief now, and I have heard her own confession. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     It is not true. 
LORD GORING.;   You know it is true.
LORD GORING.; Why, thief is written across your face at this moment. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I will deny the whole affair from beginning to end.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I will say that I have never seen this wretched thing, that it was never in my possession. 
LORD GORING.;   The drawback of stealing a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.
LORD GORING.; You can’t get that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is.
LORD GORING.; And I see you don’t know where the spring is.
LORD GORING.; It is rather difficult to find. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   You brute!
MRS CHEVELEY.; You coward!   
LORD GORING.;   Oh!
LORD GORING.; don’t use big words.
LORD GORING.; They mean so little. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;    What are you going to do? 
LORD GORING.;   I am going to ring for my servant.
LORD GORING.; He is an admirable servant.
LORD GORING.; Always comes in the moment one rings for him.
LORD GORING.; When he comes I will tell him to fetch the police. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     The police?
MRS CHEVELEY.; What for? 
LORD GORING.;   To-morrow the Berkshires will prosecute you.
LORD GORING.; That is what the police are for. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Don’t do that.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I will do anything you want.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Anything in the world you want. 
LORD GORING.;   Give me Robert Chiltern’s letter. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Stop!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Stop!
MRS CHEVELEY.; Let me have time to think. 
LORD GORING.;   Give me Robert Chiltern’s letter. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I have not got it with me.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I will give it to you to-morrow. 
LORD GORING.;   You know you are lying.
LORD GORING.; Give it to me at once.
LORD GORING.; This is it? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Yes. 
LORD GORING.;     For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have moments of admirable common sense.
LORD GORING.; I congratulate you. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Please get me a glass of water. 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly.   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thank you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Will you help me on with my cloak? 
LORD GORING.;   With pleasure.   
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Thanks.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern again. 
LORD GORING.;   Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn’t.
MRS CHEVELEY.; On the contrary, I am going to render him a great service. 
LORD GORING.;   I am charmed to hear it.
LORD GORING.; It is a reformation. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   Yes.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I can’t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so— 
LORD GORING.;   Well? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;   I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and confession has strayed into my pocket. 
LORD GORING.;   What do you mean? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     I mean that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to you to-night. 
LORD GORING.;   Love-letter? 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     ‘I want you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I trust you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; I am coming to you.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Gertrude.’ 
LORD GORING.;   You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?
LORD GORING.; Give me back that letter.
LORD GORING.; I’ll take it from you by force.
LORD GORING.; You shall not leave my room till I have got it. 
MRS CHEVELEY.;     Lord Goring merely rang that you should show me out.
MRS CHEVELEY.; Good-night, Lord Goring! 
LORD GORING.;     It is a great nuisance.
LORD GORING.; I can’t find any one in this house to talk to.
LORD GORING.; And I am full of interesting information.
LORD GORING.; I feel like the latest edition of something or other. 
JAMES.;   Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern not down yet? 
JAMES.;   Her ladyship has not yet left her room.
JAMES.; Miss Chiltern has just come in from riding. 
LORD GORING.;     Ah!
LORD GORING.; that is something. 
JAMES.;   Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir Robert.
JAMES.; I told him your lordship was here. 
LORD GORING.;   Thank you!
LORD GORING.; Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone? 
JAMES.;     I shall do so, my lord. 
LORD GORING.;   Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
LORD GORING.; It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.
LORD GORING.; I hope to goodness he won’t come up.
LORD GORING.; Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.
LORD GORING.; That is the only proper basis for family life.
LORD GORING.; Mothers are different.
LORD GORING.; Mothers are darlings.   
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Well, sir, what are you doing here?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Wasting your time as usual, I suppose? 
LORD GORING.;     My dear father, when one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not one’s own. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about last night? 
LORD GORING.;   I have been thinking about nothing else. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Engaged to be married yet? 
LORD GORING.;     Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     You can have till dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you. 
LORD GORING.;   Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before lunch. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Humph!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Never know when you are serious or not. 
LORD GORING.;   Neither do I, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning? 
LORD GORING.;     The Times?
LORD GORING.; Certainly not.
LORD GORING.; I only read _The Morning Post_.
LORD GORING.; All that one should know about modern life is where the Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading article on Robert Chiltern’s career? 
LORD GORING.;   Good heavens!
LORD GORING.; No.
LORD GORING.; What does it say? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What should it say, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Everything complimentary, of course.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since Canning. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; Never heard of Canning.
LORD GORING.; Never wanted to.
LORD GORING.; And did .
LORD GORING.; did Chiltern uphold the scheme? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Uphold it, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; How little you know him!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Why, he denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points out.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You should read this article, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; ‘Sir Robert Chiltern .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; most rising of our young statesmen .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Brilliant Orator .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Unblemished career .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Well-known integrity of character .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Represents what is best in English public life .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Noble contrast to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’  They will never say that of you, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   I sincerely hope not, father.
LORD GORING.; However, I am delighted at what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.
LORD GORING.; It shows he has got pluck. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius. 
LORD GORING.;   Ah!
LORD GORING.; I prefer pluck.
LORD GORING.; It is not so common, nowadays, as genius is. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I wish you would go into Parliament. 
LORD GORING.;   My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Why don’t you try to do something useful in life? 
LORD GORING.;   I am far too young. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     I hate this affectation of youth, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays. 
LORD GORING.;   Youth isn’t an affectation.
LORD GORING.; Youth is an art. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern? 
LORD GORING.;   I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the morning. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her accepting you. 
LORD GORING.;   I don’t know how the betting stands to-day. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in England. 
LORD GORING.;   That is just what I should like to marry.
LORD GORING.; A thoroughly sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less than six months. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   You don’t deserve her, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; How do you do, Lord Caversham?
MABEL CHILTERN.; I hope Lady Caversham is quite well? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Lady Caversham is as usual, as usual. 
LORD GORING.;   Good morning, Miss Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     And Lady Caversham’s bonnets .
MABEL CHILTERN.; are they at all better? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say. 
LORD GORING.;   Good morning, Miss Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I hope an operation will not be necessary. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     If it is, we shall have to give Lady Caversham a narcotic.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Otherwise she would never consent to have a feather touched. 
LORD GORING.;     Good morning, Miss Mabel! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Oh, are you here?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Of course you understand that after your breaking your appointment I am never going to speak to you again. 
LORD GORING.;   Oh, please don’t say such a thing.
LORD GORING.; You are the one person in London I really like to have to listen to me. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring, I never believe a single word that either you or I say to each other. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   You are quite right, my dear, quite right .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; as far as he is concerned, I mean. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Do you think you could possibly make your son behave a little better occasionally?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Just as a change. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no influence at all over my son.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I wish I had.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; If I had, I know what I would make him do. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible to influence. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   He is very heartless, very heartless. 
LORD GORING.;   It seems to me that I am a little in the way here. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   It is very good for you to be in the way, and to know what people say of you behind your back. 
LORD GORING.;   I don’t at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back.
LORD GORING.; It makes me far too conceited. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   After that, my dear, I really must bid you good morning. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; I hope you are not going to leave me all alone with Lord Goring?
MABEL CHILTERN.; Especially at such an early hour in the day. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I am afraid I can’t take him with me to Downing Street.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; It is not the Prime Minster’s day for seeing the unemployed. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     People who don’t keep their appointments in the Park are horrid. 
LORD GORING.;   Detestable. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I am glad you admit it.
MABEL CHILTERN.; But I wish you wouldn’t look so pleased about it. 
LORD GORING.;   I can’t help it.
LORD GORING.; I always look pleased when I am with you. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Then I suppose it is my duty to remain with you? 
LORD GORING.;   Of course it is. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Well, my duty is a thing I never do, on principle.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It always depresses me.
MABEL CHILTERN.; So I am afraid I must leave you. 
LORD GORING.;   Please don’t, Miss Mabel.
LORD GORING.; I have something very particular to say to you. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; is it a proposal? 
LORD GORING.;     Well, yes, it is—I am bound to say it is. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I am so glad.
MABEL CHILTERN.; That makes the second to-day. 
LORD GORING.;     The second to-day?
LORD GORING.; What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Tommy Trafford, of course.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It is one of Tommy’s days for proposing.
MABEL CHILTERN.; He always proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during the Season. 
LORD GORING.;   You didn’t accept him, I hope? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I make it a rule never to accept Tommy.
MABEL CHILTERN.; That is why he goes on proposing.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Of course, as you didn’t turn up this morning, I very nearly said yes.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It would have been an excellent lesson both for him and for you if I had.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It would have taught you both better manners. 
LORD GORING.;   Oh!
LORD GORING.; bother Tommy Trafford.
LORD GORING.; Tommy is a silly little ass.
LORD GORING.; I love you. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I know.
MABEL CHILTERN.; And I think you might have mentioned it before.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities. 
LORD GORING.;   Mabel, do be serious.
LORD GORING.; Please be serious. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Ah!
MABEL CHILTERN.; that is the sort of thing a man always says to a girl before he has been married to her.
MABEL CHILTERN.; He never says it afterwards. 
LORD GORING.;     Mabel, I have told you that I love you.
LORD GORING.; Can’t you love me a little in return? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You silly Arthur!
MABEL CHILTERN.; If you knew anything about .
MABEL CHILTERN.; anything, which you don’t, you would know that I adore you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Every one in London knows it except you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It is a public scandal the way I adore you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have been going about for the last six months telling the whole of society that I adore you.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I wonder you consent to have anything to say to me.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I have no character left at all.
MABEL CHILTERN.; At least, I feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all. 
LORD GORING.;     Dear!
LORD GORING.; Do you know I was awfully afraid of being refused! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     But you never have been refused yet by anybody, have you, Arthur?
MABEL CHILTERN.; I can’t imagine any one refusing you. 
LORD GORING.;     Of course I’m not nearly good enough for you, Mabel. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I am so glad, darling.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I was afraid you were. 
LORD GORING.;     And I’m .
LORD GORING.; I’m a little over thirty. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Dear, you look weeks younger than that. 
LORD GORING.;     How sweet of you to say so!
LORD GORING.; And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully extravagant. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   But so am I, Arthur.
MABEL CHILTERN.; So we’re sure to agree.
MABEL CHILTERN.; And now I must go and see Gertrude. 
LORD GORING.;   Must you really?   
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
LORD GORING.;   Then do tell her I want to talk to her particularly.
LORD GORING.; I have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or Robert. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Do you mean to say you didn’t come here expressly to propose to me? 
LORD GORING.;     No; that was a flash of genius. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Your first. 
LORD GORING.;     My last. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   I am delighted to hear it.
MABEL CHILTERN.; Now don’t stir.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I’ll be back in five minutes.
MABEL CHILTERN.; And don’t fall into any temptations while I am away. 
LORD GORING.;   Dear Mabel, while you are away, there are none.
LORD GORING.; It makes me horribly dependent on you. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Good morning, dear!
LADY CHILTERN.; How pretty you are looking! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   How pale you are looking, Gertrude!
MABEL CHILTERN.; It is most becoming! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Good morning, Lord Goring! 
LORD GORING.;     Good morning, Lady Chiltern! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     I shall be in the conservatory under the second palm tree on the left. 
LORD GORING.;   Second on the left? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;     Yes; the usual palm tree. 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern, I have a certain amount of very good news to tell you.
LORD GORING.; Mrs. Cheveley gave me up Robert’s letter last night, and I burned it.
LORD GORING.; Robert is safe. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Safe!
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; I am so glad of that.
LADY CHILTERN.; What a good friend you are to him—to us! 
LORD GORING.;   There is only one person now that could be said to be in any danger. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Who is that? 
LORD GORING.;     Yourself. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I?
LADY CHILTERN.; In danger?
LADY CHILTERN.; What do you mean? 
LORD GORING.;   Danger is too great a word.
LORD GORING.; It is a word I should not have used.
LORD GORING.; But I admit I have something to tell you that may distress you, that terribly distresses me.
LORD GORING.; Yesterday evening you wrote me a very beautiful, womanly letter, asking me for my help.
LORD GORING.; You wrote to me as one of your oldest friends, one of your husband’s oldest friends.
LORD GORING.; Mrs. Cheveley stole that letter from my rooms. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Well, what use is it to her?
LADY CHILTERN.; Why should she not have it? 
LORD GORING.;     Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with you.
LORD GORING.; Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   But what construction could she put on it?
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; not that!
LADY CHILTERN.; not that!
LADY CHILTERN.; If I in—in trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you, propose to come to you .
LADY CHILTERN.; that you may advise me .
LADY CHILTERN.; assist me .
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; are there women so horrible as that .
LADY CHILTERN.; And she proposes to send it to my husband?
LADY CHILTERN.; Tell me what happened.
LADY CHILTERN.; Tell me all that happened. 
LORD GORING.;   Mrs. Cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my library, without my knowledge.
LORD GORING.; I thought that the person who was waiting in that room to see me was yourself.
LORD GORING.; Robert came in unexpectedly.
LORD GORING.; A chair or something fell in the room.
LORD GORING.; He forced his way in, and he discovered her.
LORD GORING.; We had a terrible scene.
LORD GORING.; I still thought it was you.
LORD GORING.; He left me in anger.
LORD GORING.; At the end of everything Mrs. Cheveley got possession of your letter—she stole it, when or how, I don’t know. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   At what hour did this happen? 
LORD GORING.;   At half-past ten.
LORD GORING.; And now I propose that we tell Robert the whole thing at once. 
LADY CHILTERN.;    You want me to tell Robert that the woman you expected was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself?
LADY CHILTERN.; That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o’clock at night?
LADY CHILTERN.; You want me to tell him that? 
LORD GORING.;   I think it is better that he should know the exact truth. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Oh, I couldn’t, I couldn’t! 
LORD GORING.;   May I do it? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   No. 
LORD GORING.;     You are wrong, Lady Chiltern. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   No.
LADY CHILTERN.; The letter must be intercepted.
LADY CHILTERN.; That is all.
LADY CHILTERN.; But how can I do it?
LADY CHILTERN.; Letters arrive for him every moment of the day.
LADY CHILTERN.; His secretaries open them and hand them to him.
LADY CHILTERN.; I dare not ask the servants to bring me his letters.
LADY CHILTERN.; It would be impossible.
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; why don’t you tell me what to do? 
LORD GORING.;   Pray be calm, Lady Chiltern, and answer the questions I am going to put to you.
LORD GORING.; You said his secretaries open his letters. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
LORD GORING.;   Who is with him to-day?
LORD GORING.; Mr. Trafford, isn’t it? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   No.
LADY CHILTERN.; Mr. Montford, I think. 
LORD GORING.;   You can trust him? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; how do I know? 
LORD GORING.;   He would do what you asked him, wouldn’t he? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I think so. 
LORD GORING.;   Your letter was on pink paper.
LORD GORING.; He could recognise it without reading it, couldn’t he?
LORD GORING.; By the colour? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I suppose so. 
LORD GORING.;   Is he in the house now? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
LORD GORING.;   Then I will go and see him myself, and tell him that a certain letter, written on pink paper, is to be forwarded to Robert to-day, and that at all costs it must not reach him.
LORD GORING.; Oh!
LORD GORING.; Robert is coming upstairs with the letter in his hand.
LORD GORING.; It has reached him already. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; you have saved his life; what have you done with mine? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   ‘I want you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I trust you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am coming to you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Gertrude.’  Oh, my love!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Is this true?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Do you indeed trust me, and want me?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; If so, it was for me to come to you, not for you to write of coming to me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; This letter of yours, Gertrude, makes me feel that nothing that the world may do can hurt me now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You want me, Gertrude? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   You trust me, Gertrude? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Ah!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; why did you not add you loved me? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Because I loved you. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Gertrude, you don’t know what I feel.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When Montford passed me your letter across the table—he had opened it by mistake, I suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the envelope—and I read it—oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I did not care what disgrace or punishment was in store for me, I only thought you loved me still. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   There is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public shame.
LADY CHILTERN.; Mrs. Cheveley has handed over to Lord Goring the document that was in her possession, and he has destroyed it. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Are you sure of this, Gertrude? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes; Lord Goring has just told me. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Then I am safe!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; what a wonderful thing to be safe!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; For two days I have been in terror.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I am safe now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; How did Arthur destroy my letter?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Tell me. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   He burned it. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth burning to ashes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; How many men there are in modern life who would like to see their past burning to white ashes before them!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Is Arthur still here? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Yes; he is in the conservatory. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I am so glad now I made that speech last night in the House, so glad.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I made it thinking that public disgrace might be the result.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But it has not been so. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Public honour has been the result. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I think so.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I fear so, almost.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; For although I am safe from detection, although every proof against me is destroyed, I suppose, Gertrude .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; .
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I suppose I should retire from public life?   
LADY CHILTERN.;     Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.
LADY CHILTERN.; It is your duty to do that. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   It is much to surrender. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   No; it will be much to gain. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   And you would be happy living somewhere alone with me, abroad perhaps, or in the country away from London, away from public life?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You would have no regrets? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; none, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     And your ambition for me?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You used to be ambitious for me. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Oh, my ambition!
LADY CHILTERN.; I have none now, but that we two may love each other.
LADY CHILTERN.; It was your ambition that led you astray.
LADY CHILTERN.; Let us not talk about ambition. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Arthur, I have to thank you for what you have done for me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I don’t know how I can repay you. 
LORD GORING.;   My dear fellow, I’ll tell you at once.
LORD GORING.; At the present moment, under the usual palm tree .
LORD GORING.; I mean in the conservatory .
 
MASON.;   Lord Caversham. 
LORD GORING.;   That admirable father of mine really makes a habit of turning up at the wrong moment.
LORD GORING.; It is very heartless of him, very heartless indeed. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Good morning, Lady Chiltern!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Warmest congratulations to you, Chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I have just left the Prime Minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the Cabinet. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     A seat in the Cabinet? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Yes; here is the Prime Minister’s letter.   
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     A seat in the Cabinet! 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Certainly, and you well deserve it too.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You have got what we want so much in political life nowadays—high character, high moral tone, high principles.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Everything that you have not got, sir, and never will have. 
LORD GORING.;   I don’t like principles, father.
LORD GORING.; I prefer prejudices. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I cannot accept this offer, Lord Caversham.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I have made up my mind to decline it. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Decline it, sir! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   My intention is to retire at once from public life. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and retire from public life?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Chiltern, I beg your pardon.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Don’t grin like that, sir. 
LORD GORING.;   No, father. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Will you kindly prevent your husband from making such a .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; from taking such .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Will you kindly do that, Lady Chiltern? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I think my husband in right in his determination, Lord Caversham.
LADY CHILTERN.; I approve of it. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   You approve of it?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Good heavens! 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I admire him for it.
LADY CHILTERN.; I admire him immensely for it.
LADY CHILTERN.; I have never admired him so much before.
LADY CHILTERN.; He is finer than even I thought him.
LADY CHILTERN.; You will go and write your letter to the Prime Minister now, won’t you?
LADY CHILTERN.; Don’t hesitate about it, Robert. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     I suppose I had better write it at once.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Such offers are not repeated.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I will ask you to excuse me for a moment, Lord Caversham. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   I may come with you, Robert, may I not? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes, Gertrude. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What is the matter with this family?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Something wrong here, eh?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Idiocy?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Hereditary, I suppose.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Both of them, too.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Wife as well as husband.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Very sad.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Very sad indeed!
LORD CAVERSHAM.; And they are not an old family.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Can’t understand it. 
LORD GORING.;   It is not idiocy, father, I assure you. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What is it then, sir? 
LORD GORING.;     Well, it is what is called nowadays a high moral tone, father.
LORD GORING.; That is all. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Hate these new-fangled names.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Same thing as we used to call idiocy fifty years ago.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Shan’t stay in this house any longer. 
LORD GORING.;     Oh!
LORD GORING.; just go in here for a moment, father.
LORD GORING.; Third palm tree to the left, the usual palm tree. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What, sir? 
LORD GORING.;   I beg your pardon, father, I forgot.
LORD GORING.; The conservatory, father, the conservatory—there is some one there I want you to talk to. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What about, sir? 
LORD GORING.;   About me, father, 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     Not a subject on which much eloquence is possible. 
LORD GORING.;   No, father; but the lady is like me.
LORD GORING.; She doesn’t care much for eloquence in others.
LORD GORING.; She thinks it a little loud. 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern, why are you playing Mrs. Cheveley’s cards? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     I don’t understand you. 
LORD GORING.;   Mrs. Cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband.
LORD GORING.; Either to drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable position.
LORD GORING.; From the latter tragedy you saved him.
LORD GORING.; The former you are now thrusting on him.
LORD GORING.; Why should you do him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring? 
LORD GORING.;     Lady Chiltern, allow me.
LORD GORING.; You wrote me a letter last night in which you said you trusted me and wanted my help.
LORD GORING.; Now is the moment when you really want my help, now is the time when you have got to trust me, to trust in my counsel and judgment.
LORD GORING.; You love Robert.
LORD GORING.; Do you want to kill his love for you?
LORD GORING.; What sort of existence will he have if you rob him of the fruits of his ambition, if you take him from the splendour of a great political career, if you close the doors of public life against him, if you condemn him to sterile failure, he who was made for triumph and success?
LORD GORING.; Women are not meant to judge us, but to forgive us when we need forgiveness.
LORD GORING.; Pardon, not punishment, is their mission.
LORD GORING.; Why should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in his youth, before he knew you, before he knew himself?
LORD GORING.; A man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.
LORD GORING.; It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.
LORD GORING.; A woman’s life revolves in curves of emotions.
LORD GORING.; It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses.
LORD GORING.; Don’t make any terrible mistake, Lady Chiltern.
LORD GORING.; A woman who can keep a man’s love, and love him in return, has done all the world wants of women, or should want of them. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     But it is my husband himself who wishes to retire from public life.
LADY CHILTERN.; He feels it is his duty.
LADY CHILTERN.; It was he who first said so. 
LORD GORING.;   Rather than lose your love, Robert would do anything, wreck his whole career, as he is on the brink of doing now.
LORD GORING.; He is making for you a terrible sacrifice.
LORD GORING.; Take my advice, Lady Chiltern, and do not accept a sacrifice so great.
LORD GORING.; If you do, you will live to repent it bitterly.
LORD GORING.; We men and women are not made to accept such sacrifices from each other.
LORD GORING.; We are not worthy of them.
LORD GORING.; Besides, Robert has been punished enough. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   We have both been punished.
LADY CHILTERN.; I set him up too high. 
LORD GORING.;     Do not for that reason set him down now too low.
LORD GORING.; If he has fallen from his altar, do not thrust him into the mire.
LORD GORING.; Failure to Robert would be the very mire of shame.
LORD GORING.; Power is his passion.
LORD GORING.; He would lose everything, even his power to feel love.
LORD GORING.; Your husband’s life is at this moment in your hands, your husband’s love is in your hands.
LORD GORING.; Don’t mar both for him. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude, here is the draft of my letter.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Shall I read it to you? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Let me see it. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What are you doing? 
LADY CHILTERN.;   A man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.
LADY CHILTERN.; It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.
LADY CHILTERN.; Our lives revolve in curves of emotions.
LADY CHILTERN.; It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses.
LADY CHILTERN.; I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring.
LADY CHILTERN.; And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Gertrude!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Gertrude! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   You can forget.
LADY CHILTERN.; Men easily forget.
LADY CHILTERN.; And I forgive.
LADY CHILTERN.; That is how women help the world.
LADY CHILTERN.; I see that now. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     My wife!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; my wife!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, it seems that I am always to be in your debt. 
LORD GORING.;   Oh dear no, Robert.
LORD GORING.; Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not to me! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   I owe you much.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And now tell me what you were going to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in. 
LORD GORING.;   Robert, you are your sister’s guardian, and I want your consent to my marriage with her.
LORD GORING.; That is all. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Oh, I am so glad!
LADY CHILTERN.; I am so glad!   
LORD GORING.;   Thank you, Lady Chiltern. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     My sister to be your wife? 
LORD GORING.;   Yes. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Arthur, I am very sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I have to think of Mabel’s future happiness.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And I don’t think her happiness would be safe in your hands.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; And I cannot have her sacrificed! 
LORD GORING.;   Sacrificed! 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Yes, utterly sacrificed.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Loveless marriages are horrible.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; A marriage in which there is love, but on one side only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side only, and in which of the two hearts one is sure to be broken. 
LORD GORING.;   But I love Mabel.
LORD GORING.; No other woman has any place in my life. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert, if they love each other, why should they not be married? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Arthur cannot bring Mabel the love that she deserves. 
LORD GORING.;   What reason have you for saying that? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Do you really require me to tell you? 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly I do. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   As you choose.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; When I called on you yesterday evening I found Mrs. Cheveley concealed in your rooms.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It was between ten and eleven o’clock at night.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I do not wish to say anything more.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night, nothing whatsoever to do with me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; I know you were engaged to be married to her once.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; That may be so.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; But I cannot give my sister’s life into your hands.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It would be wrong of me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; It would be unjust, infamously unjust to her. 
LORD GORING.;   I have nothing more to say. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Robert, it was not Mrs. Cheveley whom Lord Goring expected last night. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   Not Mrs. Cheveley!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Who was it then? 
LORD GORING.;   Lady Chiltern! 
LADY CHILTERN.;   It was your own wife.
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, yesterday afternoon Lord Goring told me that if ever I was in trouble I could come to him for help, as he was our oldest and best friend.
LADY CHILTERN.; Later on, after that terrible scene in this room, I wrote to him telling him that I trusted him, that I had need of him, that I was coming to him for help and advice.
LADY CHILTERN.; Yes, that letter.
LADY CHILTERN.; I didn’t go to Lord Goring’s, after all.
LADY CHILTERN.; I felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can come.
LADY CHILTERN.; Pride made me think that.
LADY CHILTERN.; Mrs. Cheveley went.
LADY CHILTERN.; She stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you this morning, that you should think .
LADY CHILTERN.; Oh!
LADY CHILTERN.; Robert, I cannot tell you what she wished you to think.
 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;   What!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Had I fallen so low in your eyes that you thought that even for a moment I could have doubted your goodness?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Gertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and sin can never touch you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Arthur, you can go to Mabel, and you have my best wishes!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; Oh!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; stop a moment.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There is no name at the beginning of this letter.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does not seem to have noticed that.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.; There should be a name. 
LADY CHILTERN.;   Let me write yours.
LADY CHILTERN.; It is you I trust and need.
LADY CHILTERN.; You and none else. 
LORD GORING.;   Well, really, Lady Chiltern, I think I should have back my own letter. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     No; you shall have Mabel.   
LORD GORING.;   Well, I hope she hasn’t changed her mind.
LORD GORING.; It’s nearly twenty minutes since I saw her last. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   Lord Goring, I think your father’s conversation much more improving than yours.
MABEL CHILTERN.; I am only going to talk to Lord Caversham in the future, and always under the usual palm tree. 
LORD GORING.;   Darling!   
LORD CAVERSHAM.;     What does this mean, sir?
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You don’t mean to say that this charming, clever young lady has been so foolish as to accept you? 
LORD GORING.;   Certainly, father!
LORD GORING.; And Chiltern’s been wise enough to accept the seat in the Cabinet. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   I am very glad to hear that, Chiltern .
LORD CAVERSHAM.; I congratulate you, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; If the country doesn’t go to the dogs or the Radicals, we shall have you Prime Minister, some day. 
MASON.;   Luncheon is on the table, my Lady! 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   You’ll stop to luncheon, Lord Caversham, won’t you? 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   With pleasure, and I’ll drive you down to Downing Street afterwards, Chiltern.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; You have a great future before you, a great future.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; Wish I could say the same for you, sir.
LORD CAVERSHAM.; But your career will have to be entirely domestic. 
LORD GORING.;   Yes, father, I prefer it domestic. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   And if you don’t make this young lady an ideal husband, I’ll cut you off with a shilling. 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   An ideal husband!
MABEL CHILTERN.; Oh, I don’t think I should like that.
MABEL CHILTERN.; It sounds like something in the next world. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   What do you want him to be then, dear? 
MABEL CHILTERN.;   He can be what he chooses.
MABEL CHILTERN.; All I want is to be .
MABEL CHILTERN.; to be .
MABEL CHILTERN.; oh!
MABEL CHILTERN.; a real wife to him. 
LORD CAVERSHAM.;   Upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in that, Lady Chiltern. 
LADY CHILTERN.;     Aren’t you coming in, Robert? 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.;     Gertrude, is it love you feel for me, or is it pity merely? 
LADY CHILTERN.;     It is love, Robert.
LADY CHILTERN.; Love, and only love.
LADY CHILTERN.; For both of us a new life is beginning.
