LADY CAROLINE.;   I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley? 
HESTER.;   Yes, Lady Caroline. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   You have no country houses, I am told, in America? 
HESTER.;   We have not many. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Have you any country?
LADY CAROLINE.; What we should call country? 
HESTER.;     We have the largest country in the world, Lady Caroline.
HESTER.; They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as France and England put together. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Ah!
LADY CAROLINE.; you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
LADY CAROLINE.; John, you should have your muffler.
LADY CAROLINE.; What is the use of my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them? 
SIR JOHN.;   I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I think not, John.
LADY CAROLINE.; Well, you couldn’t come to a more charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear LADY HUNSTANTON.is sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here.
LADY CAROLINE.; Jane mixes too much.
LADY CAROLINE.; Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high distinction.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is a privilege to meet him.
LADY CAROLINE.; And that member of Parliament, Mr. Kettle— 
SIR JOHN.;   Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   He must be quite respectable.
LADY CAROLINE.; One has never heard his name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a man, nowadays.
LADY CAROLINE.; But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person. 
HESTER.;   I dislike Mrs. Allonby.
HESTER.; I dislike her more than I can say. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are invited to meet.
LADY CAROLINE.; Mrs. Allonby is very well born.
LADY CAROLINE.; She is a niece of Lord Brancaster’s.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she was married.
LADY CAROLINE.; But you know how unfair people often are.
LADY CAROLINE.; I myself don’t believe she ran away more than once. 
HESTER.;   Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Ah, yes!
LADY CAROLINE.; the young man who has a post in a bank.
LADY CAROLINE.; Lady Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to have taken quite a fancy to him.
LADY CAROLINE.; I am not sure, however, that Jane is right in taking him out of his position.
LADY CAROLINE.; In my young days, Miss Worsley, one never met any one in society who worked for their living.
LADY CAROLINE.; It was not considered the thing. 
HESTER.;   In America those are the people we respect most. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I have no doubt of it. 
HESTER.;   Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!
HESTER.; He is so simple, so sincere.
HESTER.; He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come across.
HESTER.; It is a privilege to meet _him_. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
LADY CAROLINE.; English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.
LADY CAROLINE.; They show them then. 
HESTER.;   Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young man and a young girl? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   We think it very inadvisable.
LADY CAROLINE.; Jane, I was just saying what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.
LADY CAROLINE.; You have a wonderful power of selection.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is quite a gift. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Dear Caroline, how kind of you!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I think we all do fit in very nicely together.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And I hope our charming American visitor will carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; The cushion, there, Francis.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And my shawl.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; The Shetland.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Get the Shetland.   
GERALD.;   Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.
GERALD.; Lord Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   His secretary?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; That is good news indeed, Gerald.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It means a very brilliant future in store for you.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Your dear mother will be delighted.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Do you think she would, Gerald?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I know how difficult it is to get her to go anywhere. 
GERALD.;   Oh!
GERALD.; I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord Illingworth had made me such an offer. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come up and meet him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Just wait, Francis.   
LADY CAROLINE.;   That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as you are, Mr. Arbuthnot. 
GERALD.;   It is indeed, Lady Caroline.
GERALD.; I trust I shall be able to show myself worthy of it. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I trust so. 
GERALD.;     _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss Worsley. 
HESTER.;   Are you very pleased about it? 
GERALD.;   Of course I am.
GERALD.; It means everything to me—things that were out of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now. 
HESTER.;   Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.
HESTER.; Life is a hope. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord Illingworth is aiming at.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I heard that he was offered Vienna.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But that may not be true. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I don’t think that England should be represented abroad by an unmarried man, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; It might lead to complications. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You are too nervous, Caroline.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Believe me, you are too nervous.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I was in hopes he would have married lady Kelso.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But I believe he said her family was too large.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Or was it her feet?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I forget which.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I regret it very much.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She was made to be an ambassador’s wife. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering people’s names, and forgetting their faces. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Tell Henry to wait for an answer.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I have written a line to your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she really must come to dinner. 
GERALD.;   That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.
GERALD.; Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley? 
HESTER.;   With pleasure.   
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good fortune.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And I am particularly pleased that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord without my suggesting anything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Nobody likes to be asked favours.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season, because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I saw the governess, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; Lady Pagden sent her to me.
LADY CAROLINE.; It was before Eleanor came out.
LADY CAROLINE.; She was far too good-looking to be in any respectable household.
LADY CAROLINE.; I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to get rid of her. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, that explains it. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   John, the grass is too damp for you.
LADY CAROLINE.; You had better go and put on your overshoes at once. 
SIR JOHN.;   I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.
LADY CAROLINE.; Pray do as I tell you. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed! 
  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.;   It is said to be well timbered. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Quite, quite wonderful. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I assure you, dear, that the country has not that effect at all.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I remember the occurrence perfectly.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of joy, or gout.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I forget which.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We had a large party staying here at the time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I think to elope is cowardly.
MRS ALLONBY.; It’s running away from danger.
MRS ALLONBY.; And danger has become so rare in modern life. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   As far as I can make out, the young women of the present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing with fire. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never gets even singed.
MRS ALLONBY.; It is the people who don’t know how to play with it who get burned up. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes; I see that.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It is very, very helpful. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I don’t know how the world would get on with such a theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Ah!
LADY STUTFIELD.; The world was made for men and not for women. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.
MRS ALLONBY.; We have a much better time than they have.
MRS ALLONBY.; There are far more things forbidden to us than are forbidden to them. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes; that is quite, quite true.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I had not thought of that. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work? 
KELVIL.;   I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.
KELVIL.; It has been an arduous task.
KELVIL.; The demands on the time of a public man are very heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.
KELVIL.; And I don’t think they meet with adequate recognition. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   John, have you got your overshoes on? 
SIR JOHN.;   Yes, my love. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I think you had better come over here, John.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is more sheltered. 
SIR JOHN.;   I am quite comfortable, Caroline. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I think not, John.
LADY CAROLINE.; You had better sit beside me.   
LADY STUTFIELD.;   And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr. Kelvil? 
KELVIL.;   On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.
KELVIL.; On Purity. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   That must be such a very, very interesting thing to write about. 
KELVIL.;   It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays, Lady Stutfield.
KELVIL.; I purpose addressing my constituents on the question before Parliament meets.
KELVIL.; I find that the poorer classes of this country display a marked desire for a higher ethical standard. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   How quite, quite nice of them. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr. Kettle? 
SIR JOHN.;   Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 
KELVIL.;   The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life, Lady Caroline.
KELVIL.; Women are always on the side of morality, public and private. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the important thing.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth doesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very wicked. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It must be the next world.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; This world and I are on excellent terms.   
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady Stutfield.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I have given up trying to reform him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It would take a Public Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But you have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Gerald Arbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Kind is a dreadful word.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met him, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish enough to think of doing. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   He is an admirable young man.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And his mother is one of my dearest friends.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He has just gone for a walk with our pretty American.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She is very pretty, is she not? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Far too pretty.
LADY CAROLINE.; These American girls carry off all the good matches.
LADY CAROLINE.; Why can’t they stay in their own country?
LADY CAROLINE.; They are always telling us it is the Paradise of women. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is, Lady Caroline.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is why, like Eve, they are so extremely anxious to get out of it. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Who are Miss Worsley’s parents? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   American women are wonderfully clever in concealing their parents. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Miss Worsley, Caroline, is an orphan.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Her father was a very wealthy millionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son quite hospitably, when he visited Boston.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I don’t know how he made his money, originally. 
KELVIL.;   I fancy in American dry goods. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What are American dry goods? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   American novels. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   How very singular!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Well, from whatever source her large fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She dresses exceedingly well.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; All Americans do dress well.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They get their clothes in Paris. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die they go to Paris. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Indeed?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And when bad Americans die, where do they go to? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Oh, they go to America. 
KELVIL.;   I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.
KELVIL.; It is a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   The youth of America is their oldest tradition.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It has been going on now for three hundred years.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; To hear them talk one would imagine they were in their first childhood.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; As far as civilisation goes they are in their second. 
KELVIL.;   There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American politics.
KELVIL.; I suppose you allude to that? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I wonder. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They certainly are in England.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I think they are the only people who should. 
KELVIL.;   Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; However, the House of Commons really does very little harm.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You can’t make people good by Act of Parliament,—that is something. 
KELVIL.;   You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   That is its special vice.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is the special vice of the age.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil. 
KELVIL.;   Still our East End is a very important problem. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Quite so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the problem of slavery.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And we are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Dear Dr. Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really admirable recreations for the poor during the winter.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; Blankets and coals are sufficient.
LADY CAROLINE.; There is too much love of pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.
LADY CAROLINE.; Health is what we want in modern life.
LADY CAROLINE.; The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all. 
KELVIL.;   You are quite right, Lady Caroline. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I believe I am usually right. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Horrid word ‘health.’ 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well the popular idea of health.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The English country gentleman galloping after a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable. 
KELVIL.;   May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as a better institution than the House of Commons? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   A much better institution, of course.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That makes us a civilised body. 
KELVIL.;   Are you serious in putting forward such a view? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has given them an idea, whether one is serious or not.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Nothing is serious except passion.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has been.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The only serious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And on the British intellect the illiterates play the drum. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading articles in the London newspapers. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   But do you believe all that is written in the newspapers? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I do.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Are you going, Mrs. Allonby? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Just as far as the conservatory.
MRS ALLONBY.; Lord Illingworth told me this morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly sins. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I will certainly speak to the gardener. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run away with her? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I hope so, Caroline, I am sure. 
Dear Lord Alfred, do join us.;    
LADY CAROLINE.;   You believe good of every one, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is a great fault. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one should believe evil of every one? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.
LADY CAROLINE.; Until, of course, people are found out to be good.
LADY CAROLINE.; But that requires a great deal of investigation nowadays. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty. 
KELVIL.;   Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which is so important in this century. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes, quite, quite important, is it not? 
KELVIL.;   He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the beauty of our English home-life.
KELVIL.; I would say that he was tainted with foreign ideas on the subject. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life, is there? 
KELVIL.;   It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady Stutfield.
KELVIL.; Without it we would become like our neighbours. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   That would be so, so sad, would it not? 
KELVIL.;   I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as a toy.
KELVIL.; Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.
KELVIL.; Woman is the intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.
KELVIL.; Without her we should forget the true ideals.   
LADY STUTFIELD.;   I am so very, very glad to hear you say that. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   You a married man, Mr. Kettle? 
SIR JOHN.;   Kelvil, dear, Kelvil. 
KELVIL.;   I am married, Lady Caroline. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Family? 
KELVIL.;   Yes. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   How many? 
KELVIL.;   Eight. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the seaside?   
KELVIL.;   My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   You will join them later on, no doubt? 
KELVIL.;   If my public engagements permit me. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Your public life must be a great source of gratification to Mrs. Kettle. 
SIR JOHN.;   Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;     How very, very charming those gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred. 
LORD ALFRED.;   They are awfully expensive.
LORD ALFRED.; I can only afford them when I’m in debt. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt. 
LORD ALFRED.;   One must have some occupation nowadays.
LORD ALFRED.; If I hadn’t my debts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.
LORD ALFRED.; All the chaps I know are in debt. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you a great, great deal of annoyance? 
LORD ALFRED.;   Oh, no, they write; I don’t. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   How very, very strange. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She won’t dine.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am so sorry.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But she will come in the evening.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am very pleased indeed.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She is one of the sweetest of women.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.   
LADY CAROLINE.;     A little lacking in femininity, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; Femininity is the quality I admire most in women. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     Oh!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You should hear what the Archdeacon says of her.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He regards her as his right hand in the parish.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; In the Yellow Drawing-room.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Shall we all go in?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea? 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.   
LADY CAROLINE.;   John!
LADY CAROLINE.; If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady Stutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket. 
SIR JOHN.;   Certainly, my love.   
MRS ALLONBY.;   Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their husbands, beautiful women never are! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Beautiful women never have time.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; They are always so occupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired of conjugal anxiety by this time!
MRS ALLONBY.; Sir John is her fourth! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   So much marriage is certainly not becoming.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Twenty years of romance!
MRS ALLONBY.; Is there such a thing? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Not in our day.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Women have become too brilliant.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Or the want of it in the man. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You are quite right.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; In a Temple every one should be serious, except the thing that is worshipped. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   And that should be man? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   You are thinking of Lady Stutfield! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for the last quarter of an hour. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Is she such a mystery? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   She is more than a mystery—she is a mood. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Moods don’t last. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is their chief charm. 
GERALD.;   Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and .
GERALD.; every one.
GERALD.; I hope I shall make a good secretary. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.   
MRS ALLONBY.;   You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley? 
HESTER.;   Very much indeed. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party? 
HESTER.;   I dislike London dinner-parties. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I adore them.
MRS ALLONBY.; The clever people never listen, and the stupid people never talk. 
HESTER.;   I think the stupid people talk a great deal. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, I never listen! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made you the offer.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is because I like you so much that I want to have you with me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot! 
MRS ALLONBY.;   He is very nice; very nice indeed.
MRS ALLONBY.; But I can’t stand the American young lady. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Why? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that she was only eighteen.
MRS ALLONBY.; It was most annoying. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   She is a Puritan besides— 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Ah, that is inexcusable.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I don’t mind plain women being Puritans.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the only excuse they have for being plain.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But she is decidedly pretty.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I admire her immensely.   
MRS ALLONBY.;   What a thoroughly bad man you must be! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What do you call a bad man? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The sort of man who admires innocence. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   And a bad woman? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh!
MRS ALLONBY.; the sort of woman a man never gets tired of. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You are severe—on yourself. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Define us as a sex. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Sphinxes without secrets. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Does that include the Puritan women? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of Puritan women?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made love to her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   You think there is no woman in the world who would object to being kissed? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Very few. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Are you sure? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Quite. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What do you think she’d do if I kissed her? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove.
MRS ALLONBY.; What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Fall in love with her, probably. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Is that a challenge? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It is an arrow shot into the air. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I try? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I am sorry to hear it.
MRS ALLONBY.; We women adore failures.
MRS ALLONBY.; They lean on us. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You worship successes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You cling to them. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   We are the laurels to hide their baldness. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   And they need you always, except at the moment of triumph. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   They are uninteresting then. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   How tantalising you are!   
MRS ALLONBY.;   Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like you for. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Only one thing?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And I have so many bad qualities. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.
MRS ALLONBY.; You may lose them as you grow old. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I never intend to grow old.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The soul is born old but grows young.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is the comedy of life. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   And the body is born young and grows old.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is life’s tragedy. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Its comedy also, sometimes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But what is the mysterious reason why you will always like me? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It is that you have never made love to me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I have never done anything else. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Really?
MRS ALLONBY.; I have not noticed it. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   How fortunate!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It might have been a tragedy for both of us. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   We should each have survived. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and live down anything except a good reputation. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Have you tried a good reputation? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never been subjected. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It may come. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Why do you threaten me? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan. 
FRANCIS.;   Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Tell her ladyship we are coming in. 
FRANCIS.;   Yes, my lord. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Shall we go in to tea? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Do you like such simple pleasures? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I adore simple pleasures.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; They are the last refuge of the complex.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But, if you wish, let us stay here.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Yes, let us stay here.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It ends with Revelations. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You fence divinely.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But the button has come of your foil. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I have still the mask. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It makes your eyes lovelier. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Thank you.
MRS ALLONBY.; Come. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;     What a curious handwriting!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It reminds me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Who? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Oh!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; no one.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; No one in particular.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; A woman of no importance.   
MRS ALLONBY.;   What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little! 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Persecute us?
MRS ALLONBY.; I wish they did. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear! 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without us.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Worn to shadows, dear? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Yes, Lady Hunstanton.
MRS ALLONBY.; It is such a strain keeping men up to the mark.
MRS ALLONBY.; They are always trying to escape from us. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.
LADY STUTFIELD.; Men are so very, very heartless.
LADY STUTFIELD.; They know their power and use it. 
LADY CAROLINE.;     What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!
LADY CAROLINE.; The thing to do is to keep men in their proper place. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby. 
MRS ALLONBY.;     Really?
MRS ALLONBY.; And if they’re not married? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   If they are not married, they should be looking after a wife.
LADY CAROLINE.; It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going about society.
LADY CAROLINE.; There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry within twelve months. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;     But if they’re in love with some one who, perhaps, is tied to another? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to meddle with other people’s property. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other people’s property.
MRS ALLONBY.; All men are married women’s property.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is the only true definition of what married women’s property really is.
MRS ALLONBY.; But we don’t belong to any one. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   But do you really think, dear Caroline, that legislation would improve matters in any way?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am told that, nowadays, all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I certainly never know one from the other. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon his life or not.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I have noticed a very, very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of meeting him. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   But you renew him from time to time, don’t you? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh no, Lady Caroline.
MRS ALLONBY.; I have only had one husband as yet.
MRS ALLONBY.; I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   With your views on life I wonder you married at all. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   So do I. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Oh, I hope not, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I knew his mother quite well.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Victoria Stratton?
LADY CAROLINE.; I remember her perfectly.
LADY CAROLINE.; A silly fair-haired woman with no chin. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, Ernest has a chin.
MRS ALLONBY.; He has a very strong chin, a square chin.
MRS ALLONBY.; Ernest’s chin is far too square. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?
LADY STUTFIELD.; I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be quite, quite square. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.
MRS ALLONBY.; It is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   I adore silent men. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.
MRS ALLONBY.; He talks the whole time.
MRS ALLONBY.; But he has got no conversation.
MRS ALLONBY.; What he talks about I don’t know.
MRS ALLONBY.; I haven’t listened to him for years. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Have you never forgiven him then?
LADY STUTFIELD.; How sad that seems!
LADY STUTFIELD.; But all life is very, very sad, is it not? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_ made up of exquisite moments. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes, there are moments, certainly.
LADY STUTFIELD.; But was it something very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?
LADY STUTFIELD.; Did he become angry with you, and say anything that was unkind or true? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh dear, no.
MRS ALLONBY.; Ernest is invariably calm.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves.
MRS ALLONBY.; Nothing is so aggravating as calmness.
MRS ALLONBY.; There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men.
MRS ALLONBY.; I wonder we women stand it as well as we do. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive as we are, not so finely strung.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It makes a great barrier often between husband and wife, does it not?
LADY STUTFIELD.; But I would so much like to know what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell everybody else. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Thank you, thank you.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I will make a point of repeating it. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course of his life.
MRS ALLONBY.; I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I needn’t tell you.
MRS ALLONBY.; Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any kind till after I had been actually married four or five months.
MRS ALLONBY.; I found out then that what he had told me was perfectly true.
MRS ALLONBY.; And that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear! 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Men always want to be a woman’s first love.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is their clumsy vanity.
MRS ALLONBY.; We women have a more subtle instinct about things.
MRS ALLONBY.; What we like is to be a man’s last romance. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   I see what you mean.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It’s very, very beautiful. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Did you ever hear such a thing, Caroline?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am quite surprised. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.
LADY CAROLINE.; They apparently are getting remarkably rare. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, they’re quite out of date. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   How like the middle classes! 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes—is it not?—very, very like them. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   If what you tell us about the middle classes is true, Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is much to be regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to be.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it.
MRS ALLONBY.; More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.
MRS ALLONBY.; How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear! 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.
MRS ALLONBY.; He can’t help himself.
MRS ALLONBY.; It is in his race.
MRS ALLONBY.; The History of Woman is very different.
MRS ALLONBY.; We have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common sense.
MRS ALLONBY.; We saw its dangers from the first. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most, most trying.
LADY STUTFIELD.; Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I think it would be so very, very helpful. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The Ideal Husband?
MRS ALLONBY.; There couldn’t be such a thing.
MRS ALLONBY.; The institution is wrong. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   He would probably be extremely realistic. 
MRS CAROLINE.;   The Ideal Man!
MRS CAROLINE.; Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.
MRS CAROLINE.; He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.
MRS CAROLINE.; He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.
MRS CAROLINE.; He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   But how could he do both, dear? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   He should never run down other pretty women.
MRS ALLONBY.; That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.
MRS ALLONBY.; No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract him. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about other women. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves.
MRS ALLONBY.; He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.
MRS ALLONBY.; But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing.
MRS ALLONBY.; He should never believe that we know the use of useful things.
MRS ALLONBY.; That would be unforgiveable.
MRS ALLONBY.; But he should shower on us everything we don’t want. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone.
MRS ALLONBY.; And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.
MRS ALLONBY.; And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was.
MRS ALLONBY.; And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to forgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with variations. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   How clever you are, my dear!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You never mean a single word you say. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Thank you, thank you.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It has been quite, quite entrancing.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I must try and remember it all.
LADY STUTFIELD.; There are such a number of details that are so very, very important. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal Man is to be. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   His reward?
MRS ALLONBY.; Oh, infinite expectation.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is quite enough for him. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they not? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   That makes no matter.
MRS ALLONBY.; One should never surrender. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Not even to the Ideal Man? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Certainly not to him.
MRS ALLONBY.; Unless, of course, one wants to grow tired of him. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Oh!
LADY STUTFIELD.; yes.
LADY STUTFIELD.; I see that.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It is very, very helpful.
LADY STUTFIELD.; Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?
LADY STUTFIELD.; Or are there more than one? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Oh, my dear! 
MRS ALLONBY.;     What has happened?
MRS ALLONBY.; Do tell me. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I had completely forgotten that the American young lady has been in the room all the time.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am afraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, that will do her so much good! 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Let us hope she didn’t understand much.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I think I had better go over and talk to her.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Well, dear Miss Worsley.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; How quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I suppose you have been reading a book?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; There are so many books here in the library. 
HESTER.;   No, I have been listening to the conversation. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know, dear. 
HESTER.;   I didn’t believe any of it 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   That is quite right, dear. 
HESTER.;     I couldn’t believe that any women could really hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your guests.   
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I hear you have such pleasant society in America.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Quite like our own in places, my son wrote to me. 
HESTER.;   There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.
HESTER.; But true American society consists simply of all the good women and good men we have in our country. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant too.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes. 
HESTER.;   In America we have no lower classes. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Really?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; What a very strange arrangement! 
MRS ALLONBY.;   What is that dreadful girl talking about? 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   She is painfully natural, is she not? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   There are a great many things you haven’t got in America, I am told, Miss Worsley.
LADY CAROLINE.; They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities. 
MRS ALLONBY.;     What nonsense!
MRS ALLONBY.; They have their mothers and their manners. 
HESTER.;   The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady Caroline.
HESTER.; They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the steamers, and propose to us the day after they land.
HESTER.; As for ruins, we are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or stone.   
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What is that, dear?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it not, at that place that has the curious name? 
HESTER.;     We are trying to build up life, Lady Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.
HESTER.; This sounds strange to you all, no doubt.
HESTER.; How could it sound other than strange?
HESTER.; You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.
HESTER.; How could you know?
HESTER.; You shut out from your society the gentle and the good.
HESTER.; You laugh at the simple and the pure.
HESTER.; Living, as you all do, on others and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.
HESTER.; With all your pomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know that.
HESTER.; You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.
HESTER.; You have lost life’s secret.
HESTER.; Oh, your English society seems to me shallow, selfish, foolish.
HESTER.; It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.
HESTER.; It lies like a leper in purple.
HESTER.; It sits like a dead thing smeared with gold.
HESTER.; It is all wrong, all wrong. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   I don’t think one should know of these things.
LADY STUTFIELD.; It is not very, very nice, is it? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English society so much.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You were such a success in it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And you were so much admired by the best people.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said of you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he is on beauty. 
HESTER.;   Lord Henry Weston!
HESTER.; I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.
HESTER.; A man with a hideous smile and a hideous past.
HESTER.; He is asked everywhere.
HESTER.; No dinner-party is complete without him.
HESTER.; What of those whose ruin is due to him?
HESTER.; They are outcasts.
HESTER.; They are nameless.
HESTER.; If you met them in the street you would turn your head away.
HESTER.; I don’t complain of their punishment.
HESTER.; Let all women who have sinned be punished. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear young lady! 
HESTER.;   It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be the only ones to suffer.
HESTER.; If a man and woman have sinned, let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.
HESTER.; Let them both be branded.
HESTER.; Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the one and let the other go free.
HESTER.; Don’t have one law for men and another for women.
HESTER.; You are unjust to women in England.
HESTER.; And till you count what is a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be unjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud, will be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not regarded. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask you for my cotton that is just behind you?
LADY CAROLINE.; Thank you. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am so pleased you have come up.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But I didn’t hear you announced. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton, just as I was.
MRS ALLONBY.; You didn’t tell me you had a party. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Not a party.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Only a few guests who are staying in the house, and whom you must know.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Allow me.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Lady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young American friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how wicked we are. 
HESTER.;   I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.
HESTER.; But there are some things in England— 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; The only point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s brother, about poor Lord Henry.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He is really such good company. 
Take Mrs.;  Arbuthnot’s things. 
HESTER.;   Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.
HESTER.; I am sorry for the pain I must have caused you—I— 
LADY CAROLINE.;   My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little speech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part about my brother.
LADY CAROLINE.; Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad for him.
LADY CAROLINE.; I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.
LADY CAROLINE.; But I am bound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent company, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Now, do come, dear, and make friends with Mrs. Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you told us we never admitted into society.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot comes very rarely to me.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But that is not my fault. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!
MRS ALLONBY.; I expect they are saying the most dreadful things about us. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   Do you really think so? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I was sure of it. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   How very, very horrid of them!
LADY STUTFIELD.; Shall we go onto the terrace? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the dowdies.
MRS ALLONBY.; We are only going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You will find a great many, dear, a great many.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But don’t catch cold.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We shall all miss Gerald so much, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald his secretary? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Oh, yes!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He has been most charming about it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He has the highest possible opinion of your boy.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You don’t know Lord Illingworth, I believe, dear. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I have never met him. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You know him by name, no doubt? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I am afraid I don’t.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I live so much out of the world, and see so few people.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, yes.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; That would be the last Earl but one.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He was a very curious man.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He wanted to marry beneath him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Or wouldn’t, I believe.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; There was some scandal about it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; The present Lord Illingworth is quite different.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He is very distinguished.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He does—well, he does nothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in which you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Do you think, Caroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I should fancy not at all, Jane. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   We all have our different tastes, have we not?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But Lord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he couldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Of course, he is comparatively a young man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   About four years, I think, Jane.
LADY CAROLINE.; I know it was the same year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, I remember.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; That would be about four years ago.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Of course, there were a great many people between the present Lord Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; There was—who was there, Caroline? 
LADY CAROLINE.;   There was poor Margaret’s baby.
LADY CAROLINE.; You remember how anxious she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband died shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord Ascot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic, or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite sane.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in his hair, or something very odd about him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I can’t recall what.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I often regret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son get the title. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Lady Cecilia? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one of the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir Thomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the time, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I knew them all quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady Hunstanton? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Or was it fishing, Caroline?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I forget.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But George came in for everything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has had. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Might I see him?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Can he be sent for? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Certainly, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I will send one of the servants into the dining-room to fetch him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so long.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She was quite devoted to him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms with his father.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It doesn’t matter. 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.
THE ARCHDEACON.; I have never enjoyed myself more.
THE ARCHDEACON.; Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     You see I have got Mrs. Arbuthnot to come to me at last. 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.
THE ARCHDEACON.; Mrs. Daubeny will be quite jealous of you. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you to-night.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Headache as usual, I suppose. 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she is happiest alone.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She is happiest alone. 
LADY CAROLINE.;     John!   
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   How is the most charming woman in the world? 
MRS ALLONBY.;     We are both quite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth.
MRS ALLONBY.; But what a short time you have been in the dining-room!
MRS ALLONBY.; It seems as if we had only just left. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I was bored to death.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Never opened my lips the whole time.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Absolutely longing to come in to you. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   You should have.
MRS ALLONBY.; The American girl has been giving us a lecture. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Really?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; All Americans lecture, I believe.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I suppose it is something in their climate.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What did she lecture about? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Oh, Puritanism, of course. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I am going to convert her, am I not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; How long do you give me? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   A week. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   A week is more than enough. 
GERALD.;     Dear mother! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; See me home, Gerald.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I shouldn’t have come. 
GERALD.;   I am so sorry, mother.
GERALD.; Certainly.
GERALD.; But you must know Lord Illingworth first.   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Not to-night, Gerald. 
GERALD.;   Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   With the greatest pleasure.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I’ll be back in a moment.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; People’s mothers always bore me to death.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; All women become like their mothers.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is their tragedy. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   No man does.
MRS ALLONBY.; That is his. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What a delightful mood you are in to-night!   
GERALD.;   Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as his private secretary.
GERALD.; It is a wonderful opening for me, isn’t it?
GERALD.; I hope he won’t be disappointed in me, that is all.
GERALD.; You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest himself in you for the moment. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;     Oh, Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs .
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Arbuthnot. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   There can be nothing in common between you and my son, Lord Illingworth. 
GERALD.;   Dear mother, how can you say so?
GERALD.; Of course Lord Illingworth is awfully clever and that sort of thing.
GERALD.; There is nothing Lord Illingworth doesn’t know. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear boy! 
GERALD.;   He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.
GERALD.; I feel an awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.
GERALD.; Of course, I have had so few advantages.
GERALD.; I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other chaps.
GERALD.; But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.
GERALD.; He has been awfully good to me, mother. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Lord Illingworth may change his mind.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He may not really want you as his secretary. 
GERALD.;   Mother! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so few advantages. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.
MRS ALLONBY.; Do come over. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Now, don’t let your charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The thing is quite settled, isn’t it? 
GERALD.;   I hope so.   
MRS ALLONBY.;   I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black velvet. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   She is excessively handsome.   
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Miss Worsley is going to play.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, won’t you?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to the rectory.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the violin.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Ah, I forgot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little defective, is it not? 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   Her deafness is a great privation to her.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She can’t even hear my sermons now.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She reads them at home.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she has many resources in herself, many resources. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   She reads a good deal, I suppose? 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   Just the very largest print.
THE ARCHDEACON.; The eyesight is rapidly going.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she’s never morbid, never morbid. 
GERALD.;     Do speak to my mother, Lord Illingworth, before you go into the music-room.
GERALD.; She seems to think, somehow, you don’t mean what you said to me. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Aren’t you coming? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   In a few moments.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join you later on. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, of course.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You will have a great deal to say to her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It is not every son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But I know you appreciate that, dear. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   John! 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We can’t spare her. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   So that is our son, Rachel!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Well, I am very proud of him.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He in a Harford, every inch of him.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; By the way, why Arbuthnot, Rachel? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   One name is as good as another, when one has no right to any name. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I suppose so—but why Gerald? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   After a man whose heart I broke—after my father. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Well, Rachel, what in over is over.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; All I have got to say now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The world will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be something very near, and very dear.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is a curious thing, Rachel; my life seemed to be quite complete.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It was not so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It lacked something, it lacked a son.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of him.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over twenty years.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Why not let me have him for a little now?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He is quite as much mine as yours. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Are you talking of the child you abandoned?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Of the child who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of want? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It was not I who left you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I left you because you refused to give the child a name.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Before my son was born, I implored you to marry me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I had no expectations then.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And besides, Rachel, I wasn’t much older than you were.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I was only twenty-two.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I was twenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s garden. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; As for saying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; My mother offered you six hundred a year.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But you wouldn’t take anything.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Your father was different.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that it was your duty to marry me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Of course, I was influenced by my mother.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Every man is when he is young. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I am glad to hear you say so.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Gerald shall certainly not go away with you. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What nonsense, Rachel! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Do you think I would allow my son— 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   _Our_ son. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   My son —to go away with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has tainted every moment of my days?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You don’t realise what my past has been in suffering and in shame. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think Gerald’s future considerably more important than your past. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald cannot separate his future from my past. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   That is exactly what he should do.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is exactly what you should help him to do.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What a typical woman you are!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You talk sentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But don’t let us have a scene.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the common-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for our son, leaving you and me out of the question.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What is our son at present?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate English town.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you are mistaken.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He is thoroughly discontented. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He was not discontented till he met you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You have made him so. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Of course, I made him so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But I did not leave him with a mere longing for things he could not get.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; No, I made him a charming offer.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He jumped at it, I need hardly say.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Any young man would.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And now, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my own son, you propose practically to ruin his career.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is to say, if I were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but as he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; How utterly illogical you are! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will not allow him to go. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   How can you prevent it?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What excuse can you give to him for making him decline such an offer as mine?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I won’t tell him in what relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But you daren’t tell him.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You know that.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Look how you have brought him up. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I have brought him up to be a good man. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Quite so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And what is the result?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You have educated him to be your judge if he ever finds you out.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And a bitter, an unjust judge he will be to you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Don’t be deceived, Rachel.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Children begin by loving their parents.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; After a time they judge them.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   George, don’t take my son away from me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I have had twenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only one thing to love.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and success.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; There was no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have remembered us at all.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible accident.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Forget it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Don’t come now, and rob me of .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; of all I have in the whole world.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You are so rich in other things.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Leave me the little vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of water; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; leave me that.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; George, don’t take Gerald from me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to Gerald’s career; I am.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; There is nothing more to be said on the subject. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will not let him go. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Here is Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He has a right to decide for himself. 
GERALD.;   Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord Illingworth? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I have not, Gerald. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for some reason. 
GERALD.;   Why, mother? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I didn’t know you were so anxious to leave me. 
GERALD.;   Mother, how can you talk like that?
GERALD.; Of course I have been quite happy with you.
GERALD.; But a man can’t stay always with his mother.
GERALD.; No chap does.
GERALD.; I want to make myself a position, to do something.
GERALD.; I thought you would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I do not think you would be suitable as a private secretary to Lord Illingworth.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You have no qualifications. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am the best judge.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And I can only tell you that your son has all the qualifications I had hoped for.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He has more, in fact, than I had even thought of.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Far more.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Have you any other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this post? 
GERALD.;   Have you, mother?
GERALD.; Do answer. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; We are quite by ourselves here.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Whatever it is, I need not say I will not repeat it. 
GERALD.;   Mother? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   If you would like to be alone with your son, I will leave you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I have no other reason. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as settled.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted very, very wisely. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I knew she would come round in the end. 
GERALD.;   My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.
GERALD.; She is perfectly right, too.
GERALD.; I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value whatsoever.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him. 
GERALD.;   But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Don’t be afraid, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Remember that you’ve got on your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; There is nothing like youth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The old are in life’s lumber-room.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But youth is the Lord of Life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Youth has a kingdom waiting for it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile, like most kings.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community. 
GERALD.;   But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I am old enough to be your father, Gerald. 
GERALD.;   I don’t remember my father; he died years ago. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   So LADY HUNSTANTON.told me. 
GERALD.;   It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
GERALD.; I sometimes think she must have married beneath her. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;     Really?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You have missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald? 
GERALD.;   Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.
GERALD.; No one ever had such a mother as I have had. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I am quite sure of that.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Still I should imagine that most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Don’t realise, I mean, that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such a hole as Wrockley, could you? 
GERALD.;   Oh, no!
GERALD.; It would be dreadful! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is often curiously selfish.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in it. 
GERALD.;     I suppose there is. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But good women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their interests are so petty, aren’t they? 
GERALD.;   They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care much about. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort of thing. 
GERALD.;   Oh, yes, she’s always going to church. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Ah!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; she is not modern, and to be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You want to know life as it really is.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Not to be put of with any old-fashioned theories about life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Well, what you have to do at present is simply to fit yourself for the best society.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; A man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The future belongs to the dandy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the exquisites who are going to rule. 
GERALD.;   I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; By the way, Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Sentiment is all very well for the button-hole.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But the essential thing for a necktie is style.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life. 
GERALD.;     I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.
GERALD.; I don’t know how to talk. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Oh!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact. 
GERALD.;   But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all! 
GERALD.;   I suppose society is wonderfully delightful! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   To be in it is merely a bore.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But to be out of it simply a tragedy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Society is a necessary thing.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule society.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once. 
GERALD.;   It is very difficult to understand women, is it not? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You should never try to understand them.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Women are pictures.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Men are problems.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If you want to know what a woman really means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her, don’t listen to her. 
GERALD.;   But women are awfully clever, aren’t they? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One should always tell them so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But, to the philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over mind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals. 
GERALD.;   How then can women have so much power as you say they have? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   The history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; The tyranny of the weak over the strong.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the only tyranny that lasts. 
GERALD.;   But haven’t women got a refining influence? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Nothing refines but the intellect. 
GERALD.;   Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured. 
GERALD.;   But there are good women in society, aren’t there? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Far too many. 
GERALD.;   But do you think women shouldn’t be good? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One should never tell them so, they’d all become good at once.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself. 
GERALD.;   You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Both are disappointed. 
GERALD.;   But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Perfectly happy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But the happiness of a married man, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married. 
GERALD.;   But if one is in love? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   One should always be in love.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is the reason one should never marry. 
GERALD.;   Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And one ends by deceiving others.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is what the world calls a romance.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is the one use of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation of us Harfords. 
GERALD.;   Harfords, Lord Illingworth? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   That is my family name.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You should study the Peerage, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me, and I want you to know how to live.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live in it! 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Well, I suppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a pleasant cigarette. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I suppose I am too old now to learn.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Except from you, dear Archdeacon, when you are in your nice pulpit.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But then I always know what you are going to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Come, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned out for him.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Let us sit down.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And how is your beautiful embroidery going on? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she? 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She has not touched the tambour frame for nine or ten years.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she has many other amusements.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She is very much interested in her own health. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; that is always a nice distraction, in it not?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Now, what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Do tell us. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And that, consequently, whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Now I am quite out of my depth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I usually am when Lord Illingworth says anything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And the Humane Society is most careless.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They never rescue me.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am left to sink.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I have a dim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I always try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; that quite does for me.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I haven’t a word to say.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We can’t follow Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It shuts one out from so much. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of his opinions. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You are quite right, dear. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Jane, have you seen John anywhere? 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He is with Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They seem quite happy together.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You are not going, Caroline?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Pray sit down. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   I think I had better look after John. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; And Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Lady Stutfield is very sympathetic.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about another.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; A beautiful nature. 
Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs.;  Allonby too!
Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs.; I suppose it was Mrs. Allonby I saw him with.
Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs.; Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere for you. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; the Music-room, of course.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I thought it was the Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she? 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early childhood.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great pleasure. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; dear Lady Stutfield!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; and what has Mr. Kelvil been talking to you about? 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   About Bimetallism, as well as I remember. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Bimetallism!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Is that quite a nice subject?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; However, I know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; What did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   About Patagonia. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Really?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; What a remote topic!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But very improving, I have no doubt. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.
MRS ALLONBY.; Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost all subjects.
MRS ALLONBY.; They are excessively advanced. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What do they do? 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Apparently everything. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the world is the same world, is it not? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   The world is simply divided into two classes—those who believe the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable— 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Like yourself? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Yes; I am always astonishing myself.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is the only thing that makes life worth living. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful qualities in my own nature. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah!
MRS ALLONBY.; don’t become quite perfect all at once.
MRS ALLONBY.; Do it gradually! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; At least, I hope I shan’t.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It would be most inconvenient.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Women love us for our defects.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.
MRS ALLONBY.; We forgive adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am sure you agree with me in that. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I do not, Lady Hunstanton.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I think there are many things women should never forgive. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   What sort of things? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   The ruin of another woman’s life. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very, very easily. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. 
LADY STUTFIELD.;   The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived. 
KELVIL.;   The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   There is no secret of life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Life’s aim, if it has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; There are not nearly enough.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It is quite dreadful.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It makes one so nervous about the future. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     I don’t know how it is, dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me excessively immoral.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It has been most interesting, listening to you. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   All thought is immoral.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Its very essence is destruction.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; If you think of anything, you kill it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Nothing survives being thought of. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But I have no doubt it is all quite true.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Personally, I have very little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I don’t believe in women thinking too much.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Women should think in moderation, as they should do all things in moderation. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Nothing succeeds like excess. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I hope I shall remember that.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It sounds an admirable maxim.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But I’m beginning to forget everything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It’s a great misfortune. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady Hunstanton.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; No woman should have a memory.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet whether she has got a memory or not. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You always find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important virtue.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You have the most comforting views of life. 
FARQUHAR.;   Doctor Daubeny’s carriage! 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear Archdeacon!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It is only half-past ten. 
THE ARCHDEACON.;     I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.
THE ARCHDEACON.; Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     Well, I won’t keep you from her.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I have told Farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them. 
THE ARCHDEACON.;   It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches solids now.
THE ARCHDEACON.; Lives entirely on jellies.
THE ARCHDEACON.; But she is wonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheerful.
THE ARCHDEACON.; She has nothing to complain of. 
MRS ALLONBY.;     There is a beautiful moon to-night. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Let us go and look at it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; To look at anything that is inconstant is charming nowadays. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   You have your looking-glass. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is unkind.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It merely shows me my wrinkles. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Mine is better behaved.
MRS ALLONBY.; It never tells me the truth. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Then it is in love with you. 
GERALD.;     May I come too? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Do, my dear boy.   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald! 
GERALD.;   What, mother! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It is getting late.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Let us go home. 
GERALD.;   My dear mother.
GERALD.; Do let us wait a little longer.
GERALD.; Lord Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great surprise for you.
GERALD.; We are starting for India at the end of this month. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Let us go home. 
GERALD.;   If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.
GERALD.; I’ll be back in five minutes. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not with him!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I couldn’t bear it.   
HESTER.;   What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Is it? 
HESTER.;   Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.
HESTER.; You are so different from the other women here.
HESTER.; When you came into the Drawing-room this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and pure in life.
HESTER.; I had been foolish.
HESTER.; There are things that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I heard what you said.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I agree with it, Miss Worsley. 
HESTER.;   I didn’t know you had heard it.
HESTER.; But I knew you would agree with me.
HESTER.; A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes. 
HESTER.;   She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men and women? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   She should not. 
HESTER.;   And the man should be punished in the same way? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   In the same way.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And the children, if there are children, in the same way also? 
HESTER.;   Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited on the children.
HESTER.; It is a just law.
HESTER.; It is God’s law. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It is one of God’s terrible laws. 
HESTER.;   You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes. 
HESTER.;   Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?
HESTER.; Of course there is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not everything, are they? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   They are nothing; they bring misery. 
HESTER.;   Then why do you let your son go with him? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He wishes it himself. 
HESTER.;   But if you asked him he would stay, would he not? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He has set his heart on going. 
HESTER.;   He couldn’t refuse you anything.
HESTER.; He loves you too much.
HESTER.; Ask him to stay.
HESTER.; Let me send him in to you.
HESTER.; He is on the terrace at this moment with Lord Illingworth.
HESTER.; I heard them laughing together as I passed through the Music-room. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is of no consequence. 
HESTER.;   No, I’ll tell him you want him.
HESTER.; Do—do ask him to stay.   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He won’t come—I know he won’t come. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the terrace? 
GERALD.;   No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace. 
LADY CAROLINE.;   It is very curious.
LADY CAROLINE.; It is time for him to retire. 
GERALD.;   Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.
GERALD.; I forgot all about it.
GERALD.; I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   At the prospect of going away? 
GERALD.;   Don’t put it like that, mother.
GERALD.; Of course I am sorry to leave you.
GERALD.; Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.
GERALD.; But after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as Wrockley.
GERALD.; You don’t mind it.
GERALD.; But I’m ambitions; I want something more than that.
GERALD.; I want to have a career.
GERALD.; I want to do something that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.
GERALD.; He is going to do everything for me. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I implore you not to.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Gerald, I beg you! 
GERALD.;   Mother, how changeable you are!
GERALD.; You don’t seem to know your own mind for a single moment.
GERALD.; An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance in life.
GERALD.; Yes, my one chance.
GERALD.; You don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every day, do you, mother?
GERALD.; It is very strange that when I have had such a wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my own mother.
GERALD.; Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley.
GERALD.; Who could help loving her?
GERALD.; I love her more than I have ever told you, far more.
GERALD.; And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I could—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means to me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?
GERALD.; To start like that is to find a career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.
GERALD.; If I were Lord Illingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.
GERALD.; As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I know her views on life.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She has just told them to me.   
GERALD.;   Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.
GERALD.; That is something—I am glad I have that!
GERALD.; You have always tried to crush my ambition, mother—haven’t you?
GERALD.; You have told me that the world is a wicked place, that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that sort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.
GERALD.; I think the world must be delightful.
GERALD.; I think society must be exquisite.
GERALD.; I think success is a thing worth having.
GERALD.; You have been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite wrong.
GERALD.; Lord Illingworth is a successful man.
GERALD.; He is a fashionable man.
GERALD.; He is a man who lives in the world and for it.
GERALD.; Well, I would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I would sooner see you dead. 
GERALD.;   Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?
GERALD.; Tell me—tell me right out.
GERALD.; What is it? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He is a bad man. 
GERALD.;   In what way bad?
GERALD.; I don’t understand what you mean. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will tell you. 
GERALD.;   I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same things as you do.
GERALD.; Well, men are different from women, mother.
GERALD.; It is natural that they should have different views. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he does not believe, that makes him bad.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is what he is. 
GERALD.;   Mother, is it something you know of him?
GERALD.; Something you actually know? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It is something I know. 
GERALD.;   Something you are quite sure of? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Quite sure of. 
GERALD.;   How long have you known it? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   For twenty years. 
GERALD.;   Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?
GERALD.; And what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?
GERALD.; What business is it of ours? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   What this man has been, he is now, and will be always. 
GERALD.;   Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?
GERALD.; If he did anything shameful, I will not go away with him.
GERALD.; Surely you know me well enough for that? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald, come near to me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Quite close to me, as you used to do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Gerald, there was a girl once, she was very young, she was little over eighteen at the time.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; George Harford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She knew nothing about life.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He—knew everything.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He made this girl love him.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with him one morning.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry her!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But he put the marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in him all the while.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had a child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the child might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child, who was innocent.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He refused.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; After the child was born she left him, taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She suffered terribly—she suffers now.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She will always suffer.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a leper.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The fire cannot purify her.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The waters cannot quench her anguish.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Nothing can heal her!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; no anodyne can give her sleep!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; no poppies forgetfulness!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She is lost!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord Illingworth a bad man.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him. 
GERALD.;   My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.
GERALD.; But I dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth was.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings at all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and live with him as his wife?
GERALD.; No nice girl would. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     Gerald, I withdraw all my objections.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when and where you choose. 
GERALD.;   Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.
GERALD.; You are the best woman God ever made.
GERALD.; And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe he is capable of anything infamous or base.
GERALD.; I can’t believe it of him—I can’t. 
HESTER.;     Let me go!
HESTER.; Let me go!   
HESTER.;   Oh!
HESTER.; save me—save me from him! 
GERALD.;   From whom? 
HESTER.;   He has insulted me!
HESTER.; Horribly insulted me!
HESTER.; Save me! 
GERALD.;   Who?
GERALD.; Who has dared—? 
GERALD.;    Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing as pure as my own mother.
GERALD.; You have insulted the woman I love most in the world with my own mother.
GERALD.; As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     No!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; no! 
GERALD.;     Don’t hold me, mother.
GERALD.; Don’t hold me—I’ll kill him! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald! 
GERALD.;   Let me go, I say! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Stop, Gerald, stop!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He is your own father! 
ALICE.;   LADY HUNSTANTON.and Mrs. Allonby. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Good morning, Gerald. 
GERALD.;     Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.
GERALD.; Good morning, Mrs. Allonby. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     We came to inquire for your dear mother, Gerald.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I hope she is better? 
GERALD.;   My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last night.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I think there must have been thunder in the air.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Or perhaps it was the music.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets on one’s nerves. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   It’s the same thing, nowadays. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am afraid you mean something wrong.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs. Arbuthnot’s pretty room.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned? 
MRS ALLONBY.;     It looks quite the happy English home. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her, Gerald. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that a good influence is the worst in the world. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he will change his mind.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I must certainly bring him here. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English home. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   It would do him a great deal of good, dear.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Most women in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids, foreigners, and French novels.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But here we have the room of a sweet saint.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures that one can look at without blushing. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   But I like blushing. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing, if one can do it at the proper moment.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell me I didn’t blush nearly often enough.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But then he was so very particular.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the Divorce Court.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; A most unfortunate case. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I delight in men over seventy.
MRS ALLONBY.; They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime.
MRS ALLONBY.; I think seventy an ideal age for a man. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you? 
GERALD.;   I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s secretary. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Surely not, Gerald!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It would be most unwise of you.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; What reason can you have? 
GERALD.;   I don’t think I should be suitable for the post. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
MRS ALLONBY.; But he says I am not serious enough. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this house.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in which we all live.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She won’t go into it.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; She is far too good.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It gave quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in the air. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   My dear, how can you say that?
LADY HUNSTANTON.; There is no resemblance between the two things at all.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But really, Gerald, what do you mean by not being suitable? 
GERALD.;   Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any views of life.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They are quite out of place.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; You must be guided by others in this matter.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering offer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at least, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in your career. 
GERALD.;   I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr. Arbuthnot.
MRS ALLONBY.; When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him. 
GERALD.;   I don’t wish to leave my mother. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Not leave your mother!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; If I were your mother I would insist on your going. 
ALICE.;   Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad headache, and cannot see any one this morning.   
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     A bad headache!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; I am so sorry!
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Perhaps you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald. 
GERALD.;   I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;   Well, to-morrow, then.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Ah, if you had a father, Gerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He would send you off with Lord Illingworth at once.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; But mothers are so weak.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; They give up to their sons in everything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We are all heart, all heart.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Come, dear, I must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid, is far from well.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite wonderful.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; He is the most sympathetic of husbands.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Quite a model.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot. 
GERALD.;   Good-bye. 
GERALD.;   What name can I sign?
GERALD.; I, who have no right to any name. 
LADY HUNSTANTON.;     Good-bye again, Gerald.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.
LADY HUNSTANTON.; Now, remember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth. 
MRS ALLONBY.;   _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.
MRS ALLONBY.; Mind you bring me back something nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an Indian shawl. 
GERALD.;   Mother, I have just written to him. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   To whom? 
GERALD.;   To my father.
GERALD.; I have written to tell him to come here at four o’clock this afternoon. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He shall not come here.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He shall not cross the threshold of my house. 
GERALD.;   He must come. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go at once.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him. 
GERALD.;   Mother, you don’t understand.
GERALD.; Nothing in the world would induce me to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.
GERALD.; Surely you know me well enough for that.
GERALD.; No: I have written to him to say— 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   What can you have to say to him? 
GERALD.;   Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   No. 
GERALD.;   Mother, surely you can.
GERALD.; Think, think what must be done, now, at once, within the next few days. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   There is nothing to be done. 
GERALD.;   I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must marry you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Marry me? 
GERALD.;   Mother, I will force him to do it.
GERALD.; The wrong that has been done you must be repaired.
GERALD.; Atonement must be made.
GERALD.; Justice may be slow, mother, but it comes in the end.
GERALD.; In a few days you shall be Lord Illingworth’s lawful wife. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   But, Gerald— 
GERALD.;   I will insist upon his doing it.
GERALD.; I will make him do it: he will not dare to refuse. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I will not marry Lord Illingworth. 
GERALD.;   Not marry him?
GERALD.; Mother! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will not marry him. 
GERALD.;   But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not for mine.
GERALD.; This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which for obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will not give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.
GERALD.; But surely it will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late, become the wife of the man who is my father.
GERALD.; Will not that be something? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will not marry him. 
GERALD.;   Mother, you must. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I will not.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You talk of atonement for a wrong done.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; What atonement can be made to me?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; There is no atonement possible.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I am disgraced: he is not.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; That is all.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And the ending is the ordinary ending.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The woman suffers.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The man goes free. 
GERALD.;   I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it is not.
GERALD.; But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.
GERALD.; The man shall make whatever reparation is possible.
GERALD.; It is not enough.
GERALD.; It does not wipe out the past, I know that.
GERALD.; But at least it makes the future better, better for you, mother. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth. 
GERALD.;   If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a different answer.
GERALD.; Remember, he is my father. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer would be the same.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Remember I am your mother. 
GERALD.;   Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like that; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the right, from the only proper standpoint.
GERALD.; It is to take away the bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your name, that this marriage must take place.
GERALD.; There is no alternative: and after the marriage you and I can go away together.
GERALD.; But the marriage must take place first.
GERALD.; It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but to all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he betray more. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I owe nothing to other women.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; There is not one of them to help me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for pity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Women are hard on each other.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from the room as though I were a tainted thing.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She was right.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I am a tainted thing.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I must bear them alone.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; What have women who have not sinned to do with me, or I with them?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; We do not understand each other. 
GERALD.;   I implore you to do what I ask you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous a sacrifice?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; None. 
GERALD.;   What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own child?
GERALD.; None. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Let me be the first, then.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I will not do it. 
GERALD.;   Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to believe in it also.
GERALD.; Well, surely your religion, the religion that you taught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.
GERALD.; You know it, you feel it. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I do not know it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I will not say the words the Church bids us to say.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I will not say them.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I dare not.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; No: marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is not for such as him, or such as me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I have lied to the world.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; For twenty years I have lied to the world.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I could not tell the world the truth.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Who can, ever?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But not for my own sake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; No, Gerald, no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It may be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so. 
GERALD.;   I don’t understand you now. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Men don’t understand what mothers are.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I am no different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And yet, to bear you I had to look on death.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Death fought with me for you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; All women have to fight with death to keep their children.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Death, being childless, wants our children from us.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Gerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Night and day all that long winter I tended you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; No office is too mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; how _I_ loved _you_.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Not Hannah, Samuel more.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And you needed love, for you were weakly, and only love could have kept you alive.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Only love can keep any one alive.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us better they will repay us.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But it is not so.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The world draws them from our side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in darkness.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; What should I have done in honest households?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My past was ever with me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things of life.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I had no right.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You thought I was happier working amongst the poor.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; That was my mission, you imagined.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It was not, but where else was I to go?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in Church duties.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But where else could I turn?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; God’s house is the only house where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too much in my heart.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; For, though day after day, at morn or evensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Even now that you are bitter to me I cannot repent.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I do not.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You are more to me than innocence.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I would rather be your mother—oh!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; much rather!—than have been always pure .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Oh, don’t you see?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; don’t you understand?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is my disgrace that has bound you so closely to me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is the price I paid for you—the price of soul and body—that makes me love you as I do.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Oh, don’t ask me to do this horrible thing.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame! 
GERALD.;   Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.
GERALD.; And I will be a better son to you than I have been.
GERALD.; And you and I must never leave each other .
GERALD.; but, mother .
GERALD.; I can’t help it .
GERALD.; you must become my father’s wife.
GERALD.; You must marry him.
GERALD.; It is your duty. 
HESTER.;     No, no; you shall not.
HESTER.; That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.
HESTER.; That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.
HESTER.; Leave him and come with me.
HESTER.; There are other countries than England .
HESTER.; Oh!
HESTER.; other countries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.
HESTER.; The world is very wide and very big. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   No, not for me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; For me the world is shrivelled to a palm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns. 
HESTER.;   It shall not be so.
HESTER.; We shall somewhere find green valleys and fresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.
HESTER.; Have we not both loved him? 
GERALD.;   Hester! 
HESTER.;     Don’t, don’t!
HESTER.; You cannot love me at all, unless you love her also.
HESTER.; You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to you.
HESTER.; In her all womanhood is martyred.
HESTER.; Not she alone, but all of us are stricken in her house. 
GERALD.;   Hester, Hester, what shall I do? 
HESTER.;   Do you respect the man who is your father? 
GERALD.;   Respect him?
GERALD.; I despise him!
GERALD.; He is infamous. 
HESTER.;   I thank you for saving me from him last night. 
GERALD.;   Ah, that is nothing.
GERALD.; I would die to save you.
GERALD.; But you don’t tell me what to do now! 
HESTER.;   Have I not thanked you for saving _me_? 
GERALD.;   But what should I do? 
HESTER.;   Ask your own heart, not mine.
HESTER.; I never had a mother to save, or shame. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He is hard—he is hard.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Let me go away. 
GERALD.;     Mother, forgive me: I have been to blame. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My heart is cold: something has broken it. 
HESTER.;   Ah, don’t say that.
HESTER.; Hearts live by being wounded.
HESTER.; Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow cannot break it.
HESTER.; Besides, what sorrows have you now?
HESTER.; Why, at this moment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_, and oh!
HESTER.; how dear you _have_ been always.
HESTER.; Ah!
HESTER.; be kind to him. 
GERALD.;   You are my mother and my father all in one.
GERALD.; I need no second parent.
GERALD.; It was for you I spoke, for you alone.
GERALD.; Oh, say something, mother.
GERALD.; Have I but found one love to lose another?
GERALD.; Don’t tell me that.
GERALD.; O mother, you are cruel.   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     But has he found indeed another love? 
HESTER.;   You know I have loved him always. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   But we are very poor. 
HESTER.;   Who, being loved, is poor?
HESTER.; Oh, no one.
HESTER.; I hate my riches.
HESTER.; They are a burden.
HESTER.; Let him share it with me. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   But we are disgraced.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; We rank among the outcasts Gerald is nameless.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is God’s law. 
HESTER.;   I was wrong.
HESTER.; God’s law is only Love. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     Gerald, I cannot give you a father, but I have brought you a wife. 
GERALD.;   Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   So she comes first, you are worthy.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And when you are away, Gerald .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; with .
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; her—oh, think of me sometimes.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Don’t forget me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; And when you pray, pray for me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; We should pray when we are happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald. 
HESTER.;   Oh, you don’t think of leaving us? 
GERALD.;   Mother, you won’t leave us? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I might bring shame upon you! 
GERALD.;   Mother! 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   For a little then: and if you let me, near you always. 
HESTER.;     Come out with us to the garden. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Later on, later on.   
ALICE.;   A gentleman to see you, ma’am. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Say I am not at home.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Show me the card.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Say I will not see him.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; What can you have to say to me to-day, George Harford?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You can have nothing to say to me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You must leave this house. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now, so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I assure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   My son may come in at any moment.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I saved you last night.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I may not be able to save you again.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My son feels my dishonour strongly, terribly strongly.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I beg you to go. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;     Last night was excessively unfortunate.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I wanted to kiss her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What harm is there in a kiss? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     A kiss may ruin a human life, George Harford.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; _I_ know that.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; _I_ know that too well. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   We won’t discuss that at present.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What is of importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I am extremely fond of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his conduct last night immensely.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He took up the cudgels for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He is just what I should have liked a son of mine to be.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Except that no son of mine should ever take the side of the Puritans: that is always an error.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Now, what I propose is this. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t legitimise Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But I can leave him my property.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; He can have Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in the north of England, and the house in St. James Square.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What more can a gentleman require in this world? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Nothing more, I am quite sure. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic days.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; As George Harford I had everything I wanted.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Now I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so pleasant.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Well, my proposal is this. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   The boy is to be with you for six months in the year, and with me for the other six.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; That is perfectly fair, is it not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You can have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; As for your past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; There is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she doesn’t count.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she objected to being kissed, could she?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And all the women would think her a fool and the men think her a bore.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And you need not be afraid that Gerald won’t be my heir.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest intention of marrying. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You come too late.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My son has no need of you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You are not necessary. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What do you mean, Rachel? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He does not require you. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I do not understand you. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Look into the garden.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You had better not let them see you: you bring unpleasant memories.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; She loves him.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; They love each other.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; We are safe from you, and we are going away. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Where? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not know you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You seem surprised.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; What welcome would you get from the girl whose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed, from the mother whose dishonour comes from you? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You have grown hard, Rachel. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I was too weak once.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is well for me that I have changed. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I was very young at the time.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; We men know life too early. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   And we women know life too late.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; That is the difference between men and women.   
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Rachel, I want my son.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; My money may be of no use to him now.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Bring us together, Rachel.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You can do it if you choose.   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   There is no room in my boy’s life for you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He is not interested in _you_. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Then why does he write to me? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   What do you mean? 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What letter is this?   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   That—is nothing.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Give it to me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is addressed to _me_. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You are not to open it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I forbid you to open it. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   And in Gerald’s handwriting. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It was not to have been sent.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It is a letter he wrote to you this morning, before he saw me.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; But he is sorry now he wrote it, very sorry.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You are not to open it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Give it to me. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It belongs to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You have read this letter, I suppose, Rachel? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   No. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   You know what is in it? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in what he says.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I deny it entirely.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to marry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect due to my wife.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I will marry you as soon as you choose.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I give you my word of honour. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You made that promise to me once before and broke it. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I will keep it now.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; And that will show you that I love my son, at least as much as you love him.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; For when I marry you, Rachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; High ambitions, too, if any ambition is high. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Are you serious? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Do tell me your reasons.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; They would interest me enormously. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   I have already explained them to my son. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t they?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You women live by your emotions and for them.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You have no philosophy of life. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   You are right.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; We women live by our emotions and for them.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; By our passions, and for them, if you will.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I have two passions, Lord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; You cannot kill those.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; They feed each other. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as its brother? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Do you think that terrible?
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Well it is terrible.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; All love is terrible.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; All love is a tragedy.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Oh, what a tragedy for a woman to have loved you! 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   So you really refuse to marry me? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   Because you hate me? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Yes. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   And does my son hate me as you do? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   No. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   I am glad of that, Rachel. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   He merely despises you. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What a pity!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; What a pity for him, I mean. 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Don’t be deceived, George.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Children begin by loving their parents.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; After a time they judge them.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Rarely if ever do they forgive them. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;     May I ask by what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful, passionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the father of your own child? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   It was not I who made him see it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; It was another. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   What _fin-de-siècle_ person? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.   
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;    There is not much then for me to do here, Rachel? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   Nothing. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   It is good-bye, is it? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth. 
LORD ILLINGWORTH.;   How curious!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; At this moment you look exactly as you looked the night you left me twenty years ago.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You have just the same expression in your mouth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me as you did.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I liked with.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating of small romances .
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Quarter to two!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Must be strolling back to Hunstanton.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; I’m sorry, I am, really.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.; It’s been an amusing experience to have met amongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s mistress, and one’s— 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     He would have said it.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; He would have said it. 
GERALD.;   Well, dear mother.
GERALD.; You never came out after all.
GERALD.; So we have come in to fetch you.
GERALD.; Mother, you have not been crying?   
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;   My boy!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My boy!
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; My boy!   
HESTER.;     But you have two children now.
HESTER.; You’ll let me be your daughter? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.;     Would you choose me for a mother? 
HESTER.;   You of all women I have ever known. 
GERALD.;   Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?
GERALD.; You have had a visitor.
GERALD.; Who was it? 
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; Oh! no one.  
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; No one in particular.
MRS ARBUTHNOT.; A man of no importance.
